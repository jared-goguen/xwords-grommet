here at XWord Info represents. (Every thousandth one is a milestone, so we make it a little easier to read today.) Could it be the number of NYT daily crosswords published since the <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/PS?date=2/15/1942\">very first one in 1942</a>? Why, yes it is, and today marks the TWENTY-FIVE / THOUSANDTH! An accomplishment to celebrate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pita\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Pita_felafel.jpg/480px-Pita_felafel.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:165px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"Oh, THAT kind of pocket!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I did wonder why END OF AN ERA is in the puzzle today. A veiled message? Another <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=4/1/2016\">April Fool&#39;s Day joke</a>? Nope, just a coincidence. Unless you have something awful to tell us, Joel &hellip; ?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of great entries, DECK CHAIR, PITA BREAD / E-COMMERCE / DEEP STATE. Flashy entries like these don&#39;t need a fantastic clue to make them stand out. But there weren&#39;t as many as I like in a themeless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where I thought the puzzle shined was in the cluing. So many fantastic clues that I lost count! I&#39;m usually happy when a themeless has two or three clever instances of wordplay. One that has TMTC (too many to count) makes me overjoyed. Here were my top three:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>[Net sales] is a boring financial term I saw all the time in bschool. I had to squint and blink a lot before figuring out that &quot;net&quot; meant &quot;internet.&quot; Brilliant!</li>\r\n\t<li>I&#39;m terrible at geography, so [Pocket of the Mideast] made me worry. Thankfully, it was all about the PITA pocket.</li>\r\n\t<li>TEST is indeed a [Class struggle?]. Great repurposing of a common phrase.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that the first two clues elevated already strong entries, and those entries are stacked! Made for a gold-medal SE corner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wondered if Tycho BRAHE / EAZY E might be a killer for some. But EOZY E or EEZY E &hellip; hmm. Tycho BREHE and EEZY E, that I could buy. Probably not the best crossing in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nice way to commemorate the TWENTY FIVE / THOUSANDTH NYT xw!</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>When Will asked me to make this puzzle for the 25,000 mark of the New York Times Crossword, I was honored and a little intimidated. I haven&#39;t made a themeless crossword in several years, and the bar has gotten so much higher for the smoothness and liveliness of the fill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a constructing perspective, anchoring in the two long Down entries put some extra constraints on filling this with as many lively, fresh phrases as possible. I started with that bottom right stack, and built up, finishing in the upper left corner. My focus was on limiting the amount of names and getting solid words and phrases that could receive fun clues. I think a lot of puzzles now look for the flashy modern answer, but to me, something like ELEPHANT or CONTINENTS can be just as good, just because of all of the fun cluing possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, here&#39;s to many more Times crosswords in the years to come &mdash; it&#39;s a dream come true to get to make and edit them for a living.</p>"]}
