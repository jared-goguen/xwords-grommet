That&#39;s the way to get some juice out of your themers!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, OPEL stuck out to me, as I see FORDs, KIAs, AUDIs all the time, but I&#39;ve only seen an OPEL in crosswords &mdash; even back when I was traveling all over the world. I would have much-preferred GMC (EGG MCMUFFIN, YOUNG MC), or even VW (ROE V WADE, UV WAVES). Probably others, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No doubt the GMC option would have required longer themer rebus answers, but that would have been nice. I enjoy rebuses the most when they&#39;re part of snazzy, long phrases, especially when those phrases are longer than 15 letters &ndash; it&#39;s so infrequent that you see a 16+ letter crossword entry!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, Will has told me that for rebus puzzles, the longest entries in the grid ought to contain rebuses, and I&#39;m fully on board with that now. PLAUDITS and GAUDIEST are fine words, but they&#39;re so short that they pale in comparison to the catchy OPEN AND SHUT and DANCE AROUND.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also doesn&#39;t seem right that the so-so LIMA OHIO is the same length as GAUDIEST / PLAUDITS, and SLOVAKIA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fantastic misdirect on the &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot; clue.

DIRT CHEAP, MANDELA, OLD SAWS helped make up for some of the ALII, SEL, ALC kind of crossword glue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, a solid rebus concept. These days though, the body of rebus work is so large, that new ones have to shine nearly perfectly or innovate to stand out.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>I love rebus puzzles. Years ago, back when I was more of a casual crossword solver, I remember doing this <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=5/1/2014\">alien abduction themed puzzle</a> where several squares had &quot;ET&quot; in the shape of a flying saucer and then there was a bonus &quot;COW&quot; rebus square underneath it. It completely blew my mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think about that puzzle a lot when I&#39;m hitting a writer&#39;s block and want to feel bad about how much more creative and ambitious other constructors can be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I&#39;ve been trying to come up with a good rebus theme for a while. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there weren&#39;t any car rebuses in <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Rebus\">the XWord Info database</a> because it seemed like every &quot;thing in a box&quot; idea that came to me had already been done before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially I was trying to do something with&quot;boxcars&quot; as the revealer but I found that the 11-letter &quot;compact cars&quot; made for a better grid layout, plus I think is a more fun answer.</p>"]}
