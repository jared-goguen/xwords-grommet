It&#39;s so tempting as a constructor to change one entry&#39;s tense in order to appease the gods of crossword symmetry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would have been perfect consistency if every phrase had a (verb) + THE + (noun) form. Ah well, you can&#39;t win &lsquo;em all. Just finding four solid sewing-related figures of speech, using the same tense, is a win.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solid gridwork, hard to find even a single dab of crossword glue. I think it&#39;s so elegant when you can&#39;t quite tell how the creator put it all together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DEVEIN was the lone entry that made me hesitate. It looked like such a weird string of letters. But Jill and I have DEVEINed shrimp (what a pain), so ultimately it felt fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toss in a bit of BROWN RICE and PIANO ROLL, along with ON THE SLY, and you have yourself enough bonuses to keep solvers&#39; attention. I usually prefer long bonus fill in the down direction, since long across fill tends to muddy up what is theme and what is not. But today, the themers are so apparent that BROWN RICE is perfectly fine where it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The theme wasn&#39;t exciting enough for me to put the puzzle into POW! contention, but I did appreciate seeing a theme angle I doubt I&#39;d ever think of.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>We&#39;re not <a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date%3D7/18/2017&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1528812765436000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQMAi5Bg_OMjfclUVLF85VJe8MhQ\" href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=7/18/2017\" target=\"_blank\">hitting the stairs</a> again today, though it may look that way at first glance.
