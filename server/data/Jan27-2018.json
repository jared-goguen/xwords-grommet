All three had some great entries and some compromises:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NW:</strong> MARIE CURIE! ORANGE SODA! That&#39;s the way to anchor a themeless swath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TUN, eh. MID-MARCH&hellip; doesn&#39;t that feel arbitrary? Does it open the door for LATE AUGUST, LAST FALL, etc.?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Middle:</strong> CLAM JUICE! BLOOD BORNE!

Maybe it would have been more exciting with a clever clue?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, a real mixture of great and head-scratching stuff. All in all, fair, but tough. Very tough! It&#39;s rare for me these days to not finish a Saturday puzzle, and this one defeated me. On the one hand, it made me feel stupid for not being able to overcome the challenge. But it also makes me want to improve for the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep &lsquo;em coming, Mark! (But maybe, just a tad easier? Please?)</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>Confession: Sometimes when I&#39;m writing the clues for a completed puzzle I will overreach the boundaries of what is a sound and workable clue. This is more common for me while trying to be &quot;cute and clever&quot; in fashioning end-of-the-week clues. Fortunately for the solving audience, Will Shortz and his crew are experts at discerning solid clues and reining in this &quot;creative&quot; tendency of mine when it runs amok.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I always do a post-mortem comparison of the final clues against what I originally sent in as a means of honing my clue-writing skills. The results of this usually fall into various categories:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>the clues are the same or essentially the same (yay, nailed it!)</li>\r\n\t<li>the clues are different, but both are technically sound (editor&#39;s choice)</li>\r\n\t<li>my clue was too vague (meh!), too restrictive (meh!), or inaccurate (ugh!!). For THINK YOUNG: Keep a positive state of mind (close [maybe], but not exactly accurate)</li>\r\n\t<li>my clue included a word in the puzzle (yikes!). For CLAM JUICE: Bloody Caesar ingredient (directly below BLOODBORNE [double yikes!])</li>\r\n\t<li>my clue tried to be cute or clever and fell flat (thud). For BLADES: Parts from the prop department? (as in propeller, but the joke fails since BLADES could be props in a murder mystery play [hindsight doh!])</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s hoping you found the polished puzzle entertaining.</p>"]}
