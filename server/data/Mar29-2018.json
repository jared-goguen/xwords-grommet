But perhaps it takes an incredibly clever person to appreciate it? We get different types of NUTs, growing out of the letters N U T. Thus, the nuts grow from the NUTs? Or maybe it&#39;s some sort of fractal metaphor, that you see the same thing no matter at what scale you&#39;re looking?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almond\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Green_almonds.jpg/520px-Green_almonds.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:152px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"A NUT ... within a nut?\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It feels somehow meta. Self-referential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kinda? Sorta?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was an incredibly cool set of findings &mdash; a &quot;words hidden within phrases&quot; type theme, kicked up a notch by the inclusion of the N U Ts. It boggles my mind a bit. It&#39;s hard enough to find most medium-length words within snazzy phrases, period. Toss in an extra letter (an extra constraint), and it&#39;s even tougher. Something very cool about ALMOND stretching to ALMOUND within BURIAL MOUND.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some might even say it&#39;s buried with that phrase! More meta-ness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With just three themers, David and Claire had a lot of flexibility in grid design, and they took full advantage of it. Some beauts in GIANT SQUID, BAR FIGHT / DO SHOTS, GOLF PRO, to name a few. TO NAME A FEW!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eerie, the meta-esque touches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PiZZA FACE is a colorful phrase, no doubt. But I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d strive to incorporate it. It&#39;s such a mean-sounding entry. Rich Norris over at the LAT once asked me to get rid of FOUR EYES because he wanted readers to come away uplifted from a puzzle, and that phrase potentially did the opposite. PIZZA FACE feels like a whole new level. Bleh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, I think there&#39;s a very nice crossword concept in here somewhere &mdash; things that grow out of NUTS or something. This particular implementation didn&#39;t do it for me, leaving me scratching my head even after a lot of thinking about it. But I did like the creative, innovative thought behind it, and the solid gridwork.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p><strong>Claire:</strong> The first iteration of this puzzle was actually for a Midi pack that David (who I have been lucky enough to have as my constructing mentor and friend!) and I constructed this summer. For the themed Midis we kept the themes pretty simple, so I decided to try a NUTTY-themed puzzle for fun. I was a pretty green constructor at the time so I accidentally split the grid in half in my attempt to keep the fill clean, not realizing it would be an issue. David got a good kick out of both the silly theme and poorly laid out grid, and so the NUTTY puzzle became a running joke between the two of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So when he sent me an idea for an updated, more sophisticated version of my initial idea, I couldn&#39;t help but laugh about how the infamous NUTTY puzzle had come back to haunt me. However, I couldn&#39;t turn the opportunity down! I loved David&#39;s ingenious idea to have the word NUT literally enclosed in the &quot;shell&quot; of the themers, and we spent a good amount of Skype hours working on the grid together to reach our final product. The result is something I think we&#39;re both quite happy with, especially some of the fun fill (PIZZA FACE, GIANT SQUID) that we were able to squeeze in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m most of all thrilled to be making my NYT print debut and am happy to finally be redeemed from my initial attempt.
