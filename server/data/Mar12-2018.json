Oh ye malevolent crossword grids and your 15-letter constraints!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphemus\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Polyphemus.png/196px-Polyphemus.png\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:left; height:239px; margin:6px 12px 6px 0px; width:196px\" title=\"Creepy!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the JACK OF SPADES and the JACK of hearts are ONE-EYEd. True fact! Maybe that&#39;s why spades and hearts are considered &quot;majors&quot; in contract bridge, while diamonds and clubs are &quot;minors&quot;? I always did wonder why ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love me some Greek mythology, but POLYPHEMUS sure didn&#39;t come back easily. CYCLOPS, sure. A specific cyclops &hellip; that&#39;s a tough ask for us mere mortals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SAMMY DAVIS JR has two eyes, doesn&#39;t he? Sure, one is glass. Although, he did refer to himself in this awesome quote: &quot;Talk about handicap. I&#39;m a one-eyed Negro Jew.&quot; So he seems fine to include.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BAZOOKA JOE is ONE-EYEd? He has an eye patch, but don&#39;t lots of kids wear eye patches for lazy eye or whatever?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know what would have been awesome? To have just one (letter) I in the puzzle! Maybe dead center, like the eye of the cyclops. Creepy good!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would have also liked a smoother product for a Monday. Using POLYPHEMUS is tough enough on newer solvers. Crossing it with SEEGER &ndash; SEAGER might look fine to some &ndash; is asking a lot. And you should be able to figure out HEMAL from HEME, but in my 125+ blood donations, I&#39;ve never heard someone say or write HEMAL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&#39;t mind a little toughness in a Monday puzzle. You don&#39;t want to make it TOO easy, with zero challenge. But things like HADJI crossing ESAI crossing VERSO, and RANI &hellip; that&#39;s a recipe for turning off newer solvers. No bueno!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s a fine concept, people with ONE EYE (ish). And bonuses like SUPERMAN and I CAN HELP (nice pairing!) helped keep my attention. But the execution needed several more rounds of smoothifying &mdash; no reason not to have a better final product, given the average-ish theme density.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>This is my 3rd acceptance by the NYT, with enough rejections to give me a batting average below Bob Uecker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am grateful to Joel Fagliano for his patience in getting me through this. My academic background was the Classics and I always wanted to do a &quot;one eye&quot; theme about the cyclops. One theme answer was &quot;sewing needle&quot; but that was not acceptable, and I was lucky to see a deck of cards with a one eyed jack.</p>"]}]}}
