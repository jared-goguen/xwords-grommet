appreciate a Thursday theme worth working to uncover. At first, I thought maybe BEETHOVEN had TEN symphonies &ndash; note TEN in BEE<strong>T</strong>HOV<strong>EN</strong>! &ndash; and someone forgot to circle those letters?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Beethoven.jpg/440px-Beethoven.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:208px\" title=\"BEETHOVEN's nine\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what a great idea, the solver having to COUNT THE SQUARES of the entry to arrive at the number asked for in the clues. BEETHOVEN = nine letters = nine symphonies. I vaguely remember seeing something like this before, but it felt far enough in the recesses of my mind to not lessen my delight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ARACHNID = eight letters = eight legs. MARK SPITZ = nine letters = nine gold medals. Very cool!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MISSOURI isn&#39;t as specific since you could pick any state and find some piece of numerical trivial to fit. But the number of other states a state borders is a common enough piece of info.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strong gridwork, too, Todd coming a long way in the past few years. Some of his earlier puzzles were kind of rough and gluey, but not this one. I appreciated all the long bonuses, CROUPIER, ULULATES, SNEETCHES. AE HOUSMAN was only vaguely familiar, but looking him up jogged &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot; quickly back into mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s unusual to weave a couple of long downs in the center of the puzzle &ndash; much easier to break those up. So HAUGHTY and SUITORS were even more welcome in my eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A theme with a twist, strong long bonuses, and just a bit of ALEE, LTCOL, UNIV? Easy POW! choice. Very well done, Todd!</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>The most difficult part of getting this puzzle published might have been working up the courage to send it to Will. I&#39;ve had this theme for a long time, maybe before my first NYT puzzle was published. I remember Peter Gordon said no at some point. Finding theme answers isn&#39;t so hard...if you&#39;re OK with them being short. Certainly, numbers like TRE, FOUR, and CINCO will work, as will elements BORON and CARBON (based on their atomic number...or actually, the clue would mention how many protons the atom has). But all of these are 6 letters or less. Long entries are harder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only decent long entry I thought of is MARTIN BALSAM, which I can clue as [Actor who portrayed one of this many angry men] (he was Juror #1). Maybe one of y&#39;all can come up with enough good ones to make a good puzzle. Add COUNT THE SQUARES as I did, and it should work. I give you my blessing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, having two 9-letter and two 8-letter thematic answers feels less than satisfying. But adding shorties didn&#39;t feel like it added much, and Will seems to agree. And it does make the grid look different, and the theme answers stand out less. So that&#39;s something. I hope solvers enjoyed the change of pace, as well as the unusual theme.</p>"]}]}}
