is Ms. Weintraub's fourth POW in her last nine puzzles."],"JeffNotes":["<p>Robyn is quickly becoming one of my new favorite themeless constructors. I&#39;ve loved her voice in the past, what with glorious seed entries such as <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=4/22/2016&amp;g=15&amp;d=A\">MADE YOU LOOK</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=10/7/2016&amp;g=17&amp;d=A\">MIRACLE MAX</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=12/23/2016&amp;g=1&amp;d=A\">TRACTOR BEAM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=9/23/2017&amp;g=57&amp;d=A\">RON WEASLEY</a>. Sometimes you feel like you&#39;re right on the constructor&#39;s wavelength, and Robyn knows how to tickle my fancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://montypython.wikia.com/wiki/King_Arthur\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/montypython/images/4/4b/HolyGrail036.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/700?cb=20070904000012\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:121px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"I didn't vote for him\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sure was the case today with LIVING DEAD, KING ARTHUR clued to &quot;Monty Python,&quot; and that delightful WINEMAKER clue, [Port authority?]. Beautiful stuff!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Better yet, Robyn&#39;s been honing her work, continually perfecting her craft. I&#39;d found some of her prior themelesses lacking in grid flow (choke points cutting off sections of the grid from each other), or using too much crossword glue. Not the case today! There&#39;s an ESTE and AMAN, but I&#39;d happily take those for all the goodies she worked in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the goodies! Starting off with 16 long (8+ letters) slots is a tough ask &mdash; most constructors will manage to convert maybe only 10 of those into sizzling entries. Robyn used hers to the (miracle) max, SOUND BITES, FLOORS IT, I SMELL A RAT, etc. No THERE THERE needed, because everywhere I turned, more great stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps NATTERED was more neutral than an asset? But even that is a pretty fun word. JEREMIAH may be dull for some, but what a great nickname in &quot;The Weeping Prophet&quot;!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the cluing! WINEMAKER&#39;s clue was the highlight for me, but such an innocent [Full of ups and downs] for HILLY. [Make a (GARDEN) bed?]. A TUNER gets you from station to station (not a train). [School card] wasn&#39;t a report card, but a card, as in a joker; a CLASS CLOWN. So entertaining!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loved this one. As much as I like variety in themeless constructors, Robyn is one of the few people whose byline I&#39;d like to see perhaps once a month. Maybe more.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>Jeff, I think you will be pleased to see that we have finally arrived at my post-divided-thru-the-middle themeless puzzle design. I give you 100% of the credit for pointing out that crutch, which I didn&#39;t realize I was using. Though there may be exceptions in the future, I certainly won&#39;t revisit that design without having an imaginary debate with you about it first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my puzzles, I always look to incorporate at least one exclamation, question or &quot;conversational&quot; phrase, as I think they add a different dimension to mix. Over the years I&#39;ve included: <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=10/7/2016&amp;g=60&amp;d=A\">DO ME A FAVOR</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=9/23/2017&amp;g=15&amp;d=A\">ARE YOU DONE</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=9/23/2017&amp;g=32&amp;d=D\">IT FIGURES</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=7/28/2017&amp;g=12&amp;d=D\">DO I HAVE TO</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=5/26/2017&amp;g=56&amp;d=A\">KEEP TALKING</a> and <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=12/23/2016&amp;g=31&amp;d=D\">IMPRESS ME</a>. In this particular puzzle, there are three &mdash; and it turns out that together they comprise a little story, the gripping (yet brief) tale of one character consoling another after a distressing and suspicious incident: THERE THERE, IN ANY EVENT, I SMELL A RAT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, I don&#39;t usually go looking for interesting word intersections, but I find it incredibly amusing that VEGETARIAN runs through LIVING DEAD. I keep seeing images of zombies feasting on quinoa bowls and avocado toast.</p>"]}]}}
