There&#39;s something so evocative about the HIDDEN STAIRCASE wending its way down from the TROPHY ROOM to the WINE CELLAR. Secret entrances and passageways, opened by pulling a WALL SCONCE or pushing a FALSE PANEL &ndash; fodder for many a fantastic novel!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hidden_Staircase\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7e/Origndths.jpg\" style=\"border:none; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:163px\" title=\"Why do people always think it's a good idea to go down the eerie HIDDEN STAIRCASE?\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually, I find it problematic when a grid gets segmented up, messing with my solving feng shui. But in this case, I didn&#39;t mind that the center is so choked off. In fact, it&#39;s a bonus, considering the theme of narrow, twisty passageways! Bravo, sir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wasn&#39;t sure why a TROPHY ROOM would be the start point, or the WINE CELLAR the end. But I enjoyed the Masonic cabal feel that I overlooked this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I couldn&#39;t overlook though, was issues with the execution. I enjoyed the Poe-esque conceit so much that I so badly wanted to give it the POW! Couldn&#39;t do it, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, HIDEAWAY / HIDDEN STAIRCASE is duplicative. Then CASE / BOOKCASE too? I could see it if the BOOKCASE was the thing that was pushed back to open up the HIDDEN STAIRCASE! How awesome would that have been? So much more apt than a FALSE PANEL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sadly, that wouldn&#39;t have worked, since the BOOKCASE wants to be on top, but the CASE part of the HIDDEN STAIRCASE wants to be on the bottom. So in that CASE, I&#39;d have much preferred the CASE of BOOKCASE to be more well-hidden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CASE closed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nope. Bryant had to close off his middle so much, that the rest of the puzzle was forced to contain huge wide-open spaces. In the NE alone, see DRAYS, LDS, and the Maleskan ONER. That last one is nearly a puzzle-killer to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think changing to shorter theme bonuses &mdash; from BOOKCASE to BOOK, e.g., would have helped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, fantastic idea. Stupendous. Too many execution problems, though.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>After hurrying downstairs one day, I stubbed my toe &mdash; the resulting pain soared up my leg, roller-coastered around my innards and finally skyrocketed through my head where it exploded like fireworks into the idea for this puzzle&#39;s theme. From pain to eventual pleasure in one not-so-easy step. Normally, I remain stationary and try to think outside the box when considering most themes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s been a couple of decades since the NYT published my last puzzle &mdash; I was a semi-regular contributor for both the NYT and Simon &amp; Schuster throughout the 1990s and late &lsquo;80s (back, it seems, when dirt was just invented) before stopping to pursue other hobbies. Recently, I&#39;ve taken up both writing and cartooning, and have published two e-books apiece in both genres. The lure of crafting crosswords, however, still sings to me with its siren-sweet voice, so I&#39;ve been making puzzles in bunches as of late between other projects. Unfortunately, I&#39;ve been amassing numerous rejections. I might have to try the &lsquo;hurry-down-the-stairs&#39; trick again.</p>"]}]}}
