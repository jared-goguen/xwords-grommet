Not sure I would have ever thought of it! MUTTON HEADED is so much fun to say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Sibelius\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Jean_Sibelius%2C_1913.jpg/440px-Jean_Sibelius%2C_1913.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:187px\" title=\"SIBELIUS. Now that's a mustache!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve heard of HONEY TONGUED before. Silver-tongued felt more spot-on, but honey works too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BUTTER FINGERED felt a bit odd in the adjective form. It does have dictionary support, but don&#39;t you call people butterfingers, not BUTTERFINGERED?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHICKEN LIVERED? Lily-livered, yeah. Chicken, yeah. But chicken-livered? I&#39;d be a bit chicken to use that in actual conversation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, there&#39;s PIE EYED in the middle of the grid, too. I&#39;ve seen that term in crosswords before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note how little flexibility Peter had in laying out his grid. With PIE EYED in the middle column, he was forced to place the 14s in rows 3 and 13. You can shift BUTTERFINGERED one square to the left, and/or swap it with CHICKEN LIVERED, but there&#39;s not a lot of options otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I thought Peter did pretty well with his grid bonuses, a lot of interesting entries like PROUD PAPA, SIBELIUS, RED TIDES, BUDAPEST helping keep solvers amused if they didn&#39;t connect with the theme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were some prices to pay for all the big swaths of white space: IONA, TODDS, SOV, DEO, SSE feeling gluey. It&#39;s not a trade-off I would have made for an early-week puzzle, but I can appreciate the thought behind it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More and more though, I feel that themes and grids ought to sync in their difficulty level. This felt like a Monday theme with a Friday grid, and that created some dissonance for me. It was so hard to solve the grid, for just a Monday-theme payoff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And there were several clues I struggled with:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>BADGES are [Heat shields?], in that &quot;heat&quot; is slang for police. Police badges are shaped like shields. That&#39;s very clever, but pretty tough for this early in the week.</li>\r\n\t<li>A LORELEI is similar to a siren, a female who lures sailors to their death. Thus, a &quot;rock singer.&quot;</li>\r\n\t<li>An expert in calculus isn&#39;t a mathematician, but a DDS (dentist). (Calculus is a build-up on teeth.)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from all the theme/ grid/clue difficulty mismatch problems, I enjoy encountering theme sets I wouldn&#39;t have thought of myself.</p>"]}]}}
