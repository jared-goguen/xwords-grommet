INTENDED is such a great way to anchor a themeless. Something that most everyone has heard (way too often from me, as Jill sadly would note); easy to riff on for a fun clue. Good stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rami_Malek\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/SXSW_2016_-_Rami_Malek_%2825138464364%29.jpg/440px-SXSW_2016_-_Rami_Malek_%2825138464364%29.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:166px\" title=\"RAMI MALEK\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>IM A GONER is fantastic, too. Again, a super-familiar phrase ripe for a great clue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RAMI MALEK is a different story for me. I vaguely knew his name, since Jill and I suffered through a few episodes of &quot;Mr. Robot&quot; (sorry John!). But I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s gotten to the point where I think all educated solvers ought to have heard of him. Thankfully, all the crosses felt fair, although DEMOB is such a bizarre word that the M gave me worry at first. RABI MALEK / DEBOB? As in, Bob&#39;s your uncle?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, maybe not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OMEGA DOG felt somewhere between the two extremes. It&#39;s something you should be able to figure out due to its definition, and the fact that it&#39;s composed of two familiar words. Although it&#39;s an interesting entry, I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;d ever use OMEGA DOG in conversation or otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&#39;t mind a couple of ELEV, NEV, NOT DO kind of entries &ndash; a couple are usually inevitable in any themeless. Today, what bugged me more was all the tough names. RAMI MALEK kicked it off, but ABUJA, EDD, SARG, KELSO, THARP made the puzzle feel too much like a trivia contest. Any of those are fair game (well, EDD and SARG probably less so), but overall, they combine stick out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top-notch clue for TTOP. It&#39;s a borderline entry, but a clue misdirecting toward the Grand Prix race, away from the Grand Prix model car, makes it fine in my book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot to love about the puzzle. PIXY STIX bring me back to when I loved those disgusting things. What a fantastic brand name! POST TRUTH had the opposite effect for me though, as I depend on crosswords to let me escape from the state of real life these days.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p><strong>ANDREW:</strong> Another Kings-Lieb creation! Well, maybe more of a Ki-Lieb creation, since John did the lion&#39;s share of the work on this one. After Oxford Dictionaries declared POSTTRUTH as 2016 &quot;Word of the Year,&quot; I knew it had to be a 1-Across. Thankfully for this puzzle (and sadly for everything else), facts are still flexible and POSTTRUTH is still relevant. NOPUNINTENDED was my other significant contribution (I sifted through a sea of dad jokes for the right clue, so I hope you groaned at the one I chose), and then John brought the sparkle with the other stacks. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JOHN: </strong>Writing a themeless from scratch is a daunting task, so when Andrew brought me a promising, half-filled grid and asked me if I wanted to fill in the rest, I jumped at the chance! This ended up being a &quot;2-for-1&quot; puzzle, as the last across entry in the first draft ended up as the seed for <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=8/16/2017\">our first published collaboration last August</a>. I was on a Mr. Robot watching binge at the time we wrote this and was psyched to get RAMI MALEK into the grid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, Andrew and I are excited to be hosting the second edition of Boswords, Boston&#39;s crossword puzzle tournament on Sunday, July 29. Registration opens on June 15th and you can find more information at <a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.boswords.org&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1524403698952000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHM6XybCVAHmYNJ-Dc2dxz-dOjAJA\" href=\"http://www.boswords.org/\" target=\"_blank\">www.boswords.org</a>, including info about last year&#39;s tournament. We hope to see some of you there! </p>"]}]}}
