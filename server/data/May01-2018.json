Wow, was NUEVO LEON tough to figure out! And although I&#39;d seen SHANGRI LA in crosswords before, how bizarre it looked as SHANGRILA (rhyming with &quot;Anguilla&quot;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash-lamp\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/1909_Victor_Flash_Lamp.jpg/440px-1909_Victor_Flash_Lamp.jpg\" style=\"border:none; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:187px\" title=\"Okay, that's one fun picture of a FLASH LAMP!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latter I loved, at least after finally piecing it together. Easily recognizable phrase, and it&#39;s so juicy. That&#39;s the way to execute on a theme like this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The former (actually NUEVO LEON, nuevo = new) didn&#39;t leave me with a very good feel, wondering if perhaps I got a square wrong somewhere, even after double-checking all the crosses a few times. I like learning something from a crossword, but not when it interferes with the high I get from finishing an early-week puzzle speedily and with confidence. I threw a flag for interference today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why not break up AVENUE into *AVEN and UEYS? Maybe SAFE HAVEN?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not a huge fan of SLAVE in puzzles, either. I realize some people will scoff at me for being too sensitive about this sort of thing, but when there are plenty of <a href=\"/Finder?word=??AVE\">??AVE</a> options, why not choose something that&#39;s more neutral, less likely to cheese off a subset of solvers?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, maybe there wasn&#39;t as much flexibility as usual, since the long down, FLASH LAMP, made the construction tougher. But while I appreciate long downs for their ability to snazz up a puzzle, something like FLASH LAMP doesn&#39;t do much for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(STRING TIE is better &ndash; it still feels a bit old-timey, given the Colonel Sanders clue, but it&#39;s not as odd.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;d almost rather have broken up FLASH LAMP at the second L. There was already a reasonable amount of juice in TOURIST and CEVICHE, that I&#39;d have preferred living with just those. Breaking up the long downs might have also allowed a smoothing of ELKIN / ILYA, which both felt like they were pushing the boundaries of a Tuesday. Not sure I&#39;d expect a newer solver to be able to get that square right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A solid idea, but not my ideal execution.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>The original version of today&#39;s puzzle contained TURNPIKE, hidden in UTURN and PIKESPEAK. Will suggested replacing those entries so that all four hidden answers would be local roads - hence DRIVE. I also originally clued STRINGTIE as &quot;Attire for Colonel Sanders,&quot; hoping impishly that a few solvers might enter WHITESUIT.</p>"]}]}}
