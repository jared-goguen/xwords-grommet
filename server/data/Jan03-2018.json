Not sure why these four were chosen since there are thousands of foods out there? Maybe ... NACHOs as a starter, with some TACOs, then PIZZA, wrapping it all up with CANNOLI?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sounds like a recipe for heartburn!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannoli\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Cannolo_siciliano_with_chocolate_squares.jpg/440px-Cannolo_siciliano_with_chocolate_squares.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:left; height:148px; margin:6px 12px 6px 0px; width:220px\" title=\"I can only imagine CANNOLI, yum!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Man, I&#39;m old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m terrible at judging puns. &quot;It&#39;s not your problem&quot; becoming ITS NACHO PROBLEM felt somewhat amusing, although grammatically it felt tortured. Same with LETS TACO BOUT IT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shouldn&#39;t the resulting phrase be at least remotely grammatically correct? I mean, &quot;it&#39;s <strong>A</strong> nacho problem&quot; sounds okay. &quot;You wanna pizza?&quot; kind of works. But of course, those would be riffing on nonsensical base phrases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is probably why I&#39;ve had so few pun themes accepted over the years. Stupid brain, stop being so irritatingly logical!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loved getting FAB FOUR, GENE POOL, even DATE NUT, and kicking off the puzzle with some JAZZ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only a bit of fill sticking out as construction glue: RTES, IN ONE, ALP, OCALA. The lone exception was INGE, easily avoidable in the unconstrained SE corner. But even that I can understand &mdash; he&#39;s a famous enough playwright that he&#39;s crossworthy in some minds, and I can see that GUV / VEEP might be worth the trade-off to some. Strong execution overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That clue for RIDE UP made me laugh. Dunno why it&#39;s so funny to see my three-year-old yank at her underwear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would have liked more laughs out of the puzzle, or at least a natural meal progression like SOUP, SALAD, PIZZA, CANNOLI. Still, some bonuses and the mostly smooth grid kept me engaged.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>I was visiting a local college campus a year ago, and I saw a sign in a dorm for a student mixer at a Mexican restaurant &mdash; the teaser was &quot;Let&#39;s taco &#39;bout it.&quot; I just needed to come up with three more like that with matching lengths. I had to modify &quot;You wanna pizza me?&quot; a little to make it work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I find that as time goes on, I gravitate more toward puzzles that I find humorous &mdash; even if they don&#39;t get published they are just more fun to make!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you like punny puzzles about food, consider buying Erik Agard&#39;s &quot;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Food-Thought-Crosswords-Erik-Agard/dp/1454916311/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1514675386&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=agard+food\">Food for Thought Crosswords</a>&quot; available at Amazon.com. I did, and I found it very entertaining.</p>"]}]}}
