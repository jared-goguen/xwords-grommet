(Stay with me, I promise that this all comes together.) I liked her idea, but I didn&#39;t like that she had used asymmetry to help with the fill in the center of the heart. After trying out a few dozen arrangements, one stuck in my head &mdash; a goal-post set of black squares. Maybe something very cool there &hellip; what if we could find phrases that related to both football and to love?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alas, that didn&#39;t work out. We did have a lot of fun brainstorming what BLOCKED PUNT, TOUCHDOWN, and THIRD AND LONG might mean for Valentine&#39;s Day. Heh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shortly after, it occurred to me that I had never seen this goal-post pattern used in a themeless. I was curious to see if it might open up some possibilities, a new layout that might allow for more long answers, minimal 3-letter answers, more mid-length, whatever &mdash; just as long as it was something new.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After trying a few dozen arrangements, I hit upon something close to this current version. It had room for a single 15-letter seed entry, so I scanned my lists and my memory banks to see what FOOTBALL-related ones I could use. NUCLEAR FOOTBALL kept popping back up, so I finally gave in and decided to build around it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Long and twisty crossword journey. As they usually are.</p>"]}]}}
