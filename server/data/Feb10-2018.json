It's 16-letters long. Finn Vigeland didn't care, making room for ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE too. Bravo."],"JeffNotes":["<p>Loved it! I&#39;m always nervous when I see a triple-stack &mdash; way too much crossword glue usually needed, destroying elegance &mdash; but this one was a delight. I mean, ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE! I admit that &quot;28 Days Later&quot; scared the bejeezus out of me, and let&#39;s not even mention &quot;World War Z,&quot; but ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE is a feature entry I would have loved to debut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin-Manuel_Miranda\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Lin-Manuel_Miranda_in_Hamilton.jpg/440px-Lin-Manuel_Miranda_in_Hamilton.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:171px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"Anyone who can pull off the revolutionary look is okay in my book!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plus LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA, the guy behind &quot;Hamilton&quot;? IN ALL PROBABILITY, this might be one of my favorite triple-stacks of all time. Especially considering Finn pulled it off with just an INO and the DTS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, I admit I didn&#39;t know Miranda until people made fun of me for that at the ACPT a few years ago. But now I know him! Prolific writer, even hosting SNL. Amazing guy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Finn kept the rest of the grid wide open, running the awesome MLB DRAFT, GOLDEN PEN (didn&#39;t know it, but what a great award name!), LIBATIONS, THESSALY through the stack. Such flowing grid design, never bottlenecking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heck, even the NW and SE corners have some sizzle, especially that SE with SWIFFER, SOLO CUP, and D LIST. The NW didn&#39;t have much sparkle, but the clue for ORGAN was awesome &mdash; [Player in a baseball stadium] is so innocently misdirectional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The one sticking point I had was LATE APRIL. We recently had MID MARCH, and I didn&#39;t like the arbitrary feel of that either. But if LATE APRIL (or APRIL SECOND or END OF APRIL or THIRD WEEK OF APRIL) was required to make the flowing grid keep flowing, I think it&#39;s an okay price to pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is one of my favorite themelesses in recent memory. Elegant to solve, visually stunning, and a technical marvel from a construction standpoint. I give it a Miranda-worthy Standing O.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>Go big or go home, right? For my first published triple-stack, I added an extra column to accommodate my long-time idol (and Twitter follower!) at 29-Across. I think he&#39;s worth it. Lin, I think your way with words would translate well to puzzle construction&mdash;let me know if you&#39;re interested!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m a bit sad to see the neutered clues on ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE&mdash;originally [Literary trope that&#39;s getting revived?]&mdash;and MLB DRAFT&mdash;[Occasion to cover one&#39;s bases, familiarly?]. I write a lot of themelesses for fun but often leave them sitting in my drafts folder without cluing them, so I guess I&#39;m still getting used to Will&#39;s style on late-week puzzles. I avoid partial phrases in my puzzles unless there&#39;s really no other option, so I was disappointed that 11-Across&#39;s clue change caused it to be reparsed from the Latin AMO to the two-word A MO. Other than these quibbles, I&#39;m quite pleased with the final version of this puzzle, which underwent several drafts over the last few years. Redoing themelesses until you finally get that golden fill is such a satisfying exercise, so I&#39;m glad I persisted on this one. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, I&#39;m over the moon that this puzzle is coincidentally being published the same day as the Boston launch event for <em>Down and Across</em>, the debut novel of one of my best friends, Arvin Ahmadi. Arvin began writing the book when we were college roommates, and I&#39;m honored to have served as a bit of a puzzle consultant on it (and reader of several drafts). It&#39;s a great coming-of-age story with complex, diverse characters that will assuredly appeal to puzzle fans of all ages.</p>"]}]}}
