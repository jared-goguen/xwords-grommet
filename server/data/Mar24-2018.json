He and <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?author=Mark+Diehl\">Mark Diehl</a> are two of the few constructors that regularly delve into this territory, using few or no extra black (&quot;cheater&quot;) squares. I always look forward to their work &ndash; with a healthy dose of fear, wondering if I&#39;ll be able to complete the puzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Okerlund\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Mene_Gene_Okerlund.jpg/440px-Mene_Gene_Okerlund.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:220px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"He doesn't look so MEAN\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Byron&#39;s low-word-count themelesses, I often find myself playing a role akin to the line judge in tennis:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>CHINA SHOP, cleverly hinted at by &quot;bull market&quot; &ndash; IN!</li>\r\n\t<li>NOSE SPRAY. &quot;Nasal spray,&quot; more commonly, yeah? It does seem to be a real term though ... ON THE LINE!</li>\r\n\t<li>MOTTLERS &ndash; OUT! A roll-your-own -ERS addition. Well, wait. Let&#39;s go to replay. Apparently, a MOTTLER is a real type of paintbrush? Seems to only show up on art websites, but it does appear to be legit. Ruling overturned. IN!</li>\r\n\t<li>The LOVE BOAT, IN! I can&#39;t believe my parents let me watch this when I was seven.</li>\r\n\t<li>CLEVER DICK &hellip; in? I mean, IN! Authoritatively! (running to Wikipedia) Yes, IN! This is a real term. (Apparently.)</li>\r\n\t<li>GOPER &ndash; OUT! Took me forever to parse this as GOP&#39;er. Ugh. Ugh ugh ugh. This entry hit someone in the stands in the face, right in the EMPTY EYES.</li>\r\n\t<li>EMPTY EYES &hellip; in? Out? Let&#39;s look the other way.</li>\r\n\t<li>LESSEPS? MEAN GENE? This line judge likes explorers and LOVES &ndash; I mean LOVED, ahem &ndash; pro wrestling. Unfamiliar. But definitely IN!</li>\r\n\t<li>YES INDEEDY, that&#39;s an ACE! My favorite entry of the puzzle.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Line judge ended the match mostly happy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I appreciate how much care Byron takes to avoid short crossword glue. With low word-count puzzles though, there are almost always compromises, and some of his longer material suffered. Still, mostly a winner, if after a lot of back and forth.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>For three or so years, I&#39;ve been the second most published Saturday constructor in the Times. With great fanfare, I can now say I have one half &mdash; that&#39;s a big 50% &mdash; as many Saturdays as the all-time king and all-time great <a class=\"hasphoto\" href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?author=Rich+Norris\">Rich Norris</a>. And it was possible to get halfway there only because he&#39;s taken a ten-year breather. Maybe it&#39;s like competing with Milton Berle &mdash; if I ever get close, he can just crank out a few more Saturdays for us. (Oh, that reminds me, in case there&#39;s any confusion, the second half of 6-Down is just the proper name, not an epithet.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This puzzle started with CHINA SHOP. My clue was [Bull market?], so this is probably the first time the edited clue was the exact opposite of mine. I get the change, in that the norm is that the bull wouldn&#39;t be there. But norms that proscribe wanton wreckage are not quite in vogue these days, so my version might be a bit more zeitgeisty.</p>"]}]}}
