space without resorting to long blah entries or gluey short ones. There wasn&#39;t anything that wowed me in either corner, but overall, they came out solid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/24/MythBusters_title_screen.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:123px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:219px\" title=\"The MYTHBUSTERs\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sam made his job even tougher by running long answers through them, DOT CO DOT UK and MYTHBUSTER giving the puzzle an even more open feel. I bet most other constructors who would dare tackle a 4x8 chunk would find a way to close it off, doing something like blacking out NED and BBS. Much easier that way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were a couple of BAD ACTORs holding those corners together, but nothing horrible. PARC is gettable through the crosses, and it&#39;s a fairly common word in titles of French paintings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had to stop and think about Robinson CANO. He&#39;s a big name here in Seattle, a coup to bring him over from the Yankees. He&#39;s &hellip; probably a big enough name to be crossworthy? Tough call; time will tell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B CHORD also made me pause. I&#39;m perfectly fine with B FLAT or KEY OF B or other common music terms. I&#39;m not a guitar player though &mdash; I wonder if guitarist solvers will think nothing of B CHORD? For this cellist, it&#39;s kind of weird. Not as randomly bad as B STARS, but not as good as B SHARP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was sure ROIDED had to be wrong. Apparently, it is a term in use, though, as in &quot;ROIDED out.&quot; Do yourself a favor and don&#39;t search that term on Google Images. Eew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of eew, is DOT CO DOT UK legit? Not as solid as dot com, as in the dot com boom. But probably ... fine? After much deliberation, I&#39;m still not sure!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solid themeless, but not enough sizzling long stuff and too many entries I had to stop and weigh, to be in POW! contention.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>Second puzzle in a fortnight! If you weren&#39;t sick of me after my <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=4/1/2018\">April Fool&#39;s offering</a>, then perhaps you&#39;ll be sick of me now ... my seeds for this were indeed the ridiculous-looking MICRO-USB and the even-more-ridiculous-looking DOT CO DOT UK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those of you that like your Saturdays on the crazy side, I hope I&#39;ve hit the sweet spot with that crossing from hell. For everyone else that found themselves muttering certain four-letter words at myself or the puzzle, perhaps there was at least a bit to enjoy in the remaining 66 answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don&#39;t see my byline in the next two weeks (you shouldn&#39;t), it&#39;s because I&#39;ve gone into hiding. I have no need for RIOT GEAR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>P.S.: The word &quot;web&quot; was originally omitted from the clue for 3-Down. Consider yourselves lucky.</p>"]}]}}
