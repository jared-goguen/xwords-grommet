I know I shouldn&#39;t get a little breakfast testy here, as SPERM DONORs provide a valuable service. Still, I couldn&#39;t get myself to add it to the list above due to a persisting discomfort. Why did it make me cringe a little? A little too cutesy on the clue? Still not sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a standard 70-word themeless, the long entries must all shine, and there can&#39;t be much of any crossword glue &mdash; the bar has been raised very high for this type of themeless. I thought John did an excellent job with his long entries, only NATTERED and TASTE TESTS feeling neutral to me (Will once called STRESS TESTS &quot;cheap&quot; because of all the uber-common letters).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I did end up liking AIR BAZOOKA, but what a kooky term.
