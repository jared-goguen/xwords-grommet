Jim curates our <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/GridArt\">Grid Art</a> page, and he tends to put in more than I would. But this one I have no doubt about &mdash; looks like a Magic 8 Ball filled with crossbones! Stunning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blondie_(comic_strip)\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/61/Dagwood_Sandwich_20070417.png\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; height:137px; margin:6px 0; width:472px\" title=\"BOOPADOOP!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those corners of black squares (six apiece) don&#39;t just help create neat grid art, but they make &quot;turning the corners&quot; so much easier. Those black squares nibbling away, helping stagger the starts of answers, are magic indeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of magic, wow was I surprised to get such goodness in YES MASTER / BOSTON CREAM / SISTER SOULJAH! Heck yeah! That&#39;s not supposed to happen with puzzles like this, where so many long stacked answers have to wrap around the full perimeter. (If you&#39;re one of those people who doesn&#39;t want the magic to be taken away, forget what I said about those black squares in the corners &hellip;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And MAJORITY RULES / HOME THEATER / TEXAS SIZE? Okay, that&#39;s equally as good! Seems impossible, even with those chunks of black squares in the corners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AND BOOP A DOOP (awesome name, even if I didn&#39;t recognize it) / BIG TICKET ITEM? Yes! SEND A LETTER didn&#39;t do much for me, but so far eight out of nine long slots converted into gold? That&#39;s an incredible conversion rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Too bad the east section didn&#39;t quite live up to the rest. RELEASE WAIVER is okay. MARIONETTES is fun. PANNED OUT didn&#39;t quite pan out, those +preposition phrases a bit dull. Still, an incredible quantity of long answers interlocked around the perimeter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there hadn&#39;t been quite so much in the way of esoteric mid-length entries &mdash; ANSELMO, SYNODAL, HELLENE, SARAI, the deadly AMATO / PELLA crossing, this would have been a POW! level themeless. But this type of grid arrangement is so tricky, bound to force compromises somewhere. As much as I loved the perimeter, the middle let the rest of my solving experience down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think it&#39;s a reasonable trade-off though, as you&#39;re bound to have to give up something somewhere with a layout of this difficulty.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>I don&#39;t remember exactly when I came up with this grid, but the seed for it may have been planted all the way back in summer 2011, when <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?author=Todd+Gross\" class=\"hasphoto\">Todd Gross</a> showed me the grid of his puzzle that went on to be published on <a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date%3D2/23/2013&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1516416558023000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFQ-Xlu8WWIuuM3Sb5WszTAh9wtig\" href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=2/23/2013\" target=\"_blank\">February 23, 2013</a>. At some point in the year or two after that, I came up with the MAJORITY RULES / HOME THEATER / TEXAS-SIZE combination, and went with SISTER SOULJAH after many attempts with ZIP-A-DEE-DOO-DAH failed. I then continued going clockwise through the grid, getting particularly lucky with PACHINKO, and am very thankful for the feedback I received from my fellow constructors on both the fill and clues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Had I come up with this grid today, I probably would not have pursued it, because it can be cut in two by turning the A of MAJORITY RULES and the corresponding E into blocks (this also violates one of the Chronicle of Higher Education&#39;s style guidelines). But it is always a pleasure to see the effects of Will&#39;s editing acumen, and this puzzle is no exception, some of my favorite new clues being those for 10A, 47A, 8D, 11D, 13D, and 46D.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope you enjoy solving this as much as I enjoyed making this!</p>"]}]}}
