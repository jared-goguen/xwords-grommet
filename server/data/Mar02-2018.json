This is Joe's 129th crossword for The Times.<br />     More information about the making of today's puzzle appears in the Times's daily crossword column (nytimes.com/column/wordplay)."],"JeffNotes":["<p>Another <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Celebrities\">celeb puzzle</a>! And a ton of Rachel Maddow-related entries in this themeless. I wasn&#39;t sure what a COUGH BUTTON was, but it made sense &ndash; a button pressed when you need to cough, so your listeners aren&#39;t subjected to the noise. So that&#39;s what that thing is called!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Vice_President_Al_Gore.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:192px\" title=\"Anyone notice that AL GORE looks a lot like Gavin Belson from &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;?\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also TV HOSTS, FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) REQUEST, FRONT RUNNER (as clued, to politics), SLOTTING (clued to TV programming). You&#39;d think that it&#39;s easy to seed a themeless with four long entries &ndash; one in each of the four corners &ndash; but it turns out that two, maybe three, is about the max. More than that usually causes too much stress on the grid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RMS wasn&#39;t a great way to kick off the puzzle, and APO nearby made me worry. Getting two gluey bits right away = no bueno! Thankfully, the grid was pretty clean the rest of the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(I see you, FARO.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What WAS a great way to kick of the puzzle was the clue for ROCK FANS. [Those who&#39;ve seen both Europe and Asia, say] had me badly stuck on &quot;travelers&quot; or &quot;jet-setters.&quot; Brilliant misdirection, using the rock groups named Europe and Asia!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of other great clues, too:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>&quot;Take it from me, every vote counts.&quot; So apt, for AL GORE!</li>\r\n\t<li>WICK smartly repurposing the phrase &quot;keeper of the flame.&quot;</li>\r\n\t<li>FORTUNA is a fun entry in itself, but I loved learning that she was the Roman goddess of luck.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, I didn&#39;t think this was a POW!-worthy puzzle as themelesses go &ndash; too much wastage with long entries like IPCRESS FILE, TIDIED UP, NETTER, along with the aforementioned crossword glue &ndash; but I enjoyed the Maddow-ness.</p>"]}]}}
