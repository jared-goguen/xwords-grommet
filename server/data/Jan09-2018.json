really ought to be a thing. A restaurant chain specializing in turduckens?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_and_mutton\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/British_Lamb_Cuts.svg/700px-British_Lamb_Cuts.svg.png\" style=\"border:none; float:right; height:166px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"MEAT in the middle ... colorful!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of good finds, BEEF in the middle of STRO<strong>BE EF</strong>FECT particularly strong. Always neat to see longer words with rare(ish) letters smack dab in the middle of snazzy phrases. VEAL inside LI<strong>VE A L</strong>IE was good too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wasn&#39;t as hot on LAMB inside C<strong>LAMB</strong>AKE as 1.) it&#39;s not as interesting to me to have a word hidden completely inside a single word (across two words feels more fun), and 2.) isn&#39;t CLAM another type of meat? Sort of? The other, <em>other</em> white meat? Felt a little odd to have the double meatiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And HAM is easier to find within phrases like FIFTH AMENDMENT, LAUGH A MINUTE, ALPHA MALE, etc. Three-letter hidden words don&#39;t catch my attention as much since they&#39;re easier to uncover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I loved ANTI TANK and ZOOT SUIT! Great bonuses. Typically I&#39;d be worried about them laid out in the across direction since that could muddy up theme vs. fill. But since there aren&#39;t any shaded letters in these guys, it&#39;s fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other goodies in SPRAY CAN, SKORTS, and SPACE X. Excellent bonuses for all the vegetarian solvers out there!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not as smooth as I&#39;d like in an early-week puzzle, though. I hitched early on with ARPEL, but thank goodness all the crossings were easy. I&#39;m okay to learn a new brand name. Not as okay to run into OTB, SDS (I think it&#39;s a fine entry, but many newer solvers might not be familiar with Students for a Democratic Society), IT OFF, SNO, ITE, SKED. Two or three of these and a puzzle loses its feeling of elegance and craftsmanship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s hard to say what might have helped. Maybe not stacking NORTH AMERICA and LIVE A LIE? Putting LIVE A LIE in row 3 and NORTH AMERICA in row 5 might have spaced things out better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, a solid hidden-word theme using a fun reVEALer, but I would have liked some rework to improve smoothness, even if it meant reducing some of the snazziness.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>Puzzle ideas can pop up in the strangest places. This idea for one puzzle was generated a little less than a year ago while doing the <a href=\"http://crosswordfiend.com/2017/01/24/wednesday-january-25-2017/#la\">January 25, 2017 Los Angeles Times puzzle</a> by my friend and sometimes co-constructor <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?author=Bruce+Haight\" class=\"hasphoto\">Bruce Haight</a>. The first two themed answers I got in Bruce&#39;s puzzle were LIVE A LITTLE and MEET IN THE MIDDLE. For some reason the VEAL inside LIVE A LITTLE jumped out at me, so I thought to myself, &quot;I see where you&#39;re going, Bruce!&quot;. I figured there would be various meats (like VEAL) hidden inside longer phrases, with MEET IN THE MIDDLE as the revealer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it turned out, Bruce&#39;s theme was entirely different. It consisted of five phrases that ended in the five fingers on one&#39;s hand: LITTLE, INDEX, MIDDLE, RING, and THUMB. So I took what I thought was Bruce&#39;s concept and turned it into this puzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My original submission didn&#39;t have circles or shaded squares, but I guess on a Tuesday they&#39;re probably necessary.</p>"]}]}}
