At first, I was turned off by the visually jarring shotgun spray of circles strewn across the grid, but I ended up liking the general effect after figuring out what was going on. The longer ones &mdash; MAGAZINE and MIDDLE AGE spreads &mdash; were particularly nice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve seen this concept with various letters SPREAD through a single entry many times, <a href=\"http://crosswordfiend.com/2017/06/19/tuesday-june-20-2017/\">most recently a few months ago</a>, but never spread across a full row. Nice way to get the longer SPREADs worked in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obol_(coin)\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Charon-obol2.jpg/420px-Charon-obol2.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:105px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"These, apparently, are OBOLI?\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being able to spread letters across an entire row gives a ton of flexibility. Look at how many spots the letters W I N G can go. Shift them all around to heaven and back!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using six theme rows &mdash; plus the SPREAD revealer! &mdash; takes most of that flexibility away, and then some. It&#39;s particularly difficult in the middle of the puzzle, where you have so many MAGAZINE and MIDDLE AGE letters that get crammed into those two close rows. Not a surprise to get some A MEMO SEM OBOLI there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And UVW, oof! These types of crutch entries are so inelegant that I would have restarted the entire puzzle if it ever came to something like this. Will has his own &quot;puzzle-killers&quot; that DQ a grid just by themselves, and this would have been one of mine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s way too much crossword glue needed to pull this audacious grid off. Given how much more impressed I was with MIDDLE AGE (compared to WING), I think sticking to just the four long SPREADs would have resulted in a better puzzle. Might have also allowed for a snazzier long entry than WHERESOEVER &mdash; something like CHECK PLEASE or HEATED SEATS or HORSE SENSE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I like the twist on the SPREAD idea though, using entire rows to accomplish the goal. Great way to pull off the longer SPREADs that other constructors using this concept haven&#39;t been able to use.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>Hi to everyone. It&#39;s great to have a crossword in the Times again. I built this puzzle back in the fall of 2016. The published version looks very similar to what I originally submitted, but with some clues simplified for a Tuesday-level solve. (Clue that survived: &quot;Rear admiral&#39;s rear&quot; for STERN. Clue that did not survive: &quot;TX separatists, loosely speaking?&quot; for UVW.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember reworking the bottom of this grid just barely pre-submission, once it occurred to me that I could not only have the SPREAD revealer but could reuse its &quot;E&quot; to unfold a BEDSPREAD in the bottom row. Somehow, that &quot;aha&quot; moment made the puzzle an extra-fun one for me to have constructed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hopefully, the slowly appearing circled answers will result in spreading some fun &quot;aha&quot; moments among the solvers, somewhere around mid-solve.</p>"]}]}}
