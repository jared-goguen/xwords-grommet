Love the variety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Smackdown_2015_Logo.png\" style=\"border:none; float:right; height:100px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"Ricky &quot;The Dragon&quot; Steamboat fans, anyone?\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 72-word puzzle has to be jazzy, with every single long slot used to its max. I used to watch a ton of WWE as a kid (sad, I know), so SMACKDOWN made me smile. I&#39;m not an opera fan, but I appreciate Wagner. And RHINEGOLD is an interesting word.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BEACH COMB, yes! CACAO TREE yes! (Have you ever seen cacao fruit? Disgusting, hard to imagine how it transforms into chocolate.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CRAWDADDY &hellip; mostly yes? Seems like this is a term in use, although it didn&#39;t ring true to my ear at first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>STANDEE ... not so much. DONATE TO is fine, but it&#39;s not going to win any awards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AM I TO BLAME &hellip; I&#39;m not sure on this one. I like it just fine, but is it a standout? NOT SPAM is the same. I see this phrase all the time with Gmail, but there&#39;s something about it that makes it seem slightly iffy as a crossword entry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And HEADCOUNTS &hellip; occasionally people ask me how many plurals is too many in one puzzle, and I scratch my head. Why does it matter, if they&#39;re all normal words / entries? HEADCOUNTS does feel more sparkly in the singular, though. Totally subjective, since the plural HEADCOUNTS is dictionary supported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Short fill. A 72-word puzzle must be ultra-clean. A bit of NEOS, GRAS, ROTOS, ACRO wouldn&#39;t be terrible in a tougher construction. But a 72-word themeless is not much of a challenge (unless you&#39;re working in a lot of rare letters, grid-spanning entries, etc.). So it&#39;s way too much in this puzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That SW corner was particularly problematic for me, with ACRO / ROTOS jammed in. (I think NGAIO Marsh is crossworthy.) Maybe a cheater square at the S of HEADCOUNTS would have solved the problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some nice feature entries &mdash; love me some SMACKDOWN! &mdash; but not quite enough sparkle or cleanliness to make the puzzle stand out.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>9-Down and the first half of 10-Down... sheer happenstance. Unforeseen. They just fell into place. Good &mdash; it&#39;s done, no need to squeeze WHITENED into a future puzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started with SMACKDOWN, cluing it as a verbal broadside that might elicit an &quot;oh, snap.&quot; But the wrestling reference seems more mainstream. Glad to see Will (and Joel and Sam) cluing TOTES as it&#39;s now sometimes used. Like WHATEVS in a puzzle from last week. Is OBVS very far behind? I do check with some of my kids now and again for fresh words and phrases they view as legit. Oh, and 28-Across is a debut for me, either singular or plural, finally breaking my commitment-to-self never to use it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do attempt to mix spoken phrases and sentences (AM I TO BLAME, et al.) into the grid, minimize abbreviations (3 here, I think), and allow one partial max per grid (WALLA). I&#39;ve been to both my place names: WALLA Walla twice &mdash; beautiful town, orchard country, with a colorful display of murals; OPORTO also (for ten days or so), where you can cruise through samples of vintage Quinta Do Noval, about the finest thing ever to emerge from a grape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fun note: SECRET WORD was originally MADE-UP WORD, which I loved (like nearly anything from &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;), but it was nixed in a previous draft as a, you guessed it, &quot;made-up word.&quot; Minds may change about that down the road.</p>"]}]}}
