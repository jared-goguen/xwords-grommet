CTHULHU in his last themeless, and I enjoyed it, what with my fascination with HP Lovecraft. It&#39;s such an awesomely bizarre string of letters!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I imagine that other solvers might have hated it &ndash; if you don&#39;t already know it, it&#39;s such a horribly bizarre string of letters!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queequeg\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Queequeg.JPG/440px-Queequeg.JPG\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:left; height:250px; margin:6px 12px 6px 0px; width:151px\" title=\"QUEEQUEG\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I bet QUEEQUEG and TZATZIKI will elicit similar responses today. I understand if some solvers rage at the kooky-looking entries, but I loved them. Great way to incorporate rare letters, those Qs and Zs immediately injecting some zing into the solving experience. Plus, QUEEQUEG is from a classic, Moby Dick, so educated solvers ought to at least be familiar with the cast of characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toss in an X in XENON GAS, and another Z in TRAVEL SIZE? Love it! And yet another Z in GODZILLA? Yes! I don&#39;t like it when constructors force in rare letters, glopping glue all over to hold the grid together, so it was a real treat to get so many rare ones with just the negligible AGTS employed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And let&#39;s not forget about the other great entries Trenton worked in. TIME SLOT. UNSUNG HERO. ALTAR BOY. SPAMALOT. TIRE IRON. YES AND NO? Nope, definitely yes!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Impressively clever clues, too. MANHOLES is a solid entry. Playing on &quot;main&quot; &ndash; in this case, a water main &ndash; made it even better. &quot;Good to go&quot; hinting at TRAVEL SIZE was fantastic, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s not a revolutionary grid &ndash; not that hard to execute on a 70-word themeless. But Trenton used his four corner stacks so well and knitted everything together so elegantly. A work of art.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>Though this is the third themeless puzzle I constructed, it is the first one where I did not begin with a set grid pattern, but instead built the grid around my initial seed entry. I started in the upper-left corner with QUEEQUEG, and after a decent number of attempts to place it at 1-Across, I realized that as my favorite literary harpooner&#39;s name is 5/8 vowels, it might fit better in the second row. When I noticed that 1-Across would most likely have to start with A, E, I or S, my proclivity toward unusual letter combinations (and contrarianism) led me to wonder if I could get it to begin with something else. Seeing the possibility of 1-Down being GQ MODEL or GQ TYPE, I looked for a solid potential 1-Across answer starting with G, and once I found GODZILLA, the rest of the corner soon fell into place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the corner is a bit more partitioned off than I would prefer (and AGTS isn&#39;t the world&#39;s best entry), it still stands out to me as one of my favorites from my themeless constructions for both its Scrabbliness and sheer unexpectedness. That said, the thing I like most about the upper-left is perhaps the intersection of the consonant-free entries OUI OUI and EIEIO&mdash;how often does that happen?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UNSUNG HERO came next, as it was by far my preferred choice for 19-Across. As I worked my way through the rest of the grid, I was pleased to incorporate, among other entries, XENON GAS, TRAVEL SIZE, TZATZIKI, and YES AND NO, as well as the complementary pair of COWGIRL and ALTAR BOY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was pleasantly surprised to see how many of my clues survived this time around. Of my originals, I was particularly glad that 1-Across, 12-Down, 19-Across, 33-Down, 46-Down, and 51-Across made the cut. My favorite, though, has to be &quot;He had a heel that wouldn&#39;t heal&quot; for ACHILLES, which I had thought might be a tad too cutesy to be allowed as a part of the imposing brain-buster that is the NYT Saturday puzzle&mdash; glad I was wrong! On that note, I hope you enjoyed your solving experience (and my ACHILLES clue).</p>"]}]}}
