HUNT. Kind of a mini-theme with BLAME GAME! I wish both of these had gotten more clever clues &mdash; BLAME GAME especially could have gotten some &quot;finger-pointing&quot; misdirection &mdash; but some entries are strong enough in their own right to stand out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E!_News\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/E%21_News_current_logo.png/500px-E%21_News_current_logo.png\" style=\"border:none; float:right; height:157px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"E! News (not e-news)\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEXCAPADE looks like another potential seed entry. Feels a bit dated, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Get it, dated? As in &quot;went out with&quot;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(crickets)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyhoo, maybe SEXCAPADE stands the test of time? But it doesn&#39;t feel fresh to me these days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried to figure out what Randy might have prioritized in the NE corner. Certainly not POSSESSES, a neutral entry that&#39;s a constructor&#39;s crutch what with all those Es and Ss. ANTI LABOR? Maybe? Hopefully not STALINIST. Yikes. Not sure why this is any better than NAZI PARTY or something, given how many people lost their lives to STALINIST policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a perfect example of a grid that would have benefitted from a higher word count. At 68, it&#39;s right around the threshold at which most constructors (not named Patrick Berry) struggle. I&#39;ll leave it to the reader to count up the gluey bits (abbrs, esoteric names, partials, arbitrary number-letters, etc.). It&#39;s way over my threshold of what makes for an elegant puzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One that might surprise you is ENEWS ... It&#39;s perfectly fine! Some solvers roll their eyes at various E- addition entries, like ECASH, ETAIL, etc. But I think if it&#39;s in general use, it&#39;s A-okay. And E! News is a pretty popular show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For traditional themelesses (ones that feature four triple-stacked entries, one in each corner), I much prefer a 70 or 72-word layout, which makes a grid so much easier to fill with color and cleanliness. I&#39;m pretty sure black squares at the S of GUAVAS and first S of SEESAW would have helped a ton, for example.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>Haven&#39;t had a themeless for a while, used to do a lot of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This one was seeded with WITCH HUNT and BLAME GAME, two entries that have unfortunately become part of our political discourse. Some Russians were in the mix &mdash; NICHOLAS I and STALINIST to add to the Russian investigation mix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was happy to include CATS EYES and DOG SPAS, another pair of cousins. SEXCAPADE is a rare entry, as is ENEWS... I bet we get some comment on another E word. BUD SELIG and PETER ROGET are a couple of nice full name answers, as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wish I could have gotten rid of HGT, my least favorite entry.</p>"]}]}}
