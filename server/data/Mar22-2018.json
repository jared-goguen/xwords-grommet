an early/mid-week puzzle should be. (Yes, I know Thursday isn&#39;t early/mid-week. Stay tuned.) Plays on social media terms &mdash; a VALLEY GIRL has a lot of &quot;likes.&quot; ROCKIN&#39; ROBIN has all sorts of &quot;tweets.&quot; A MAJORITY OWNER has a ton of &quot;shares.&quot; I appreciate that Ross was able to find so many snazzy phrases that I&#39;d happily use in a themeless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joffrey_Baratheon\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bd/Joffrey_Baratheon-Jack_Gleeson.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:175px\" title=\"Dude gave me so many creeps I had to stop watching the show\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>MOTHER DUCK (with all her &quot;followers&quot;) was good too, but that one I might give the side-eye in any other puzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FENCE MENDER ... thankfully, it&#39;s the only themer that dips into the &quot;definitional&quot; category that plagues this type of theme. Imagine if MAJORITY OWNER had been PERSON OWNING STOCK. Much less fun, yeah?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some funnage in the fill, too, with King JOFFREY of &quot;Game of Thrones.&quot; Thank goodness dude got his due, AMEN AMEN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of aMEN, what&#39;s an AREA MAN, you ask? Good question. The dictionary defines it as &hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, if you have to say &quot;The dictionary defines it as &hellip;&quot; it&#39;s probably not a fantastic grid entry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>KEPT MAN is kind of a colorful term, but a bit cringy. And the dupe of MAN made AREA MAN feel even worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EDM is &hellip; &quot;electronic dance music&quot;? It&#39;s still a globby piece of crossword glue since it&#39;s impossible to figure out if you don&#39;t already know it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I might have considered this for the POW! if it had been run on a Wednesday or Tuesday. It feels like the NYT is falling down with the avant-garde Thursdays that used to help distinguish it; to feature its ability to be clever. Yes, it&#39;s tough to come up with something innovative every week. But others, like the <a href=\"https://avxwords.com/#/\">American Values Club</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fireballcrosswords.com/\">Fireball</a>, have been doing it with a higher rate of success than the NYT recently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love the NYT crossword. It&#39;s one of the things that drew me and my wife together. I don&#39;t want to see it slowly lose its cachet. Will, I hope you find a way to solve this problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, an easy and mostly lovely &mdash; but so, so, so disappointingly non-cutting-edge &mdash; romp.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>I was admonished not to give a real-life villain the satisfaction of being in the puzzle, unless I was prepared to remind him of how appropriately IMMOBILE he is there in his Ecuadorian RECLINER.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AMEN AMEN.</p>"]}]}}
