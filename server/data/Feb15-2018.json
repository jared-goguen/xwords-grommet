Definitely important to add something extra. It is fortuitous that all five of these roles were Oscar-nominated &hellip; but that wasn&#39;t enough for me to distinguish it from all the rest of the instances Peter cited. It&#39;s unrelated to the theme, so even though it does create extra tightness in the theme set, it didn&#39;t feel relevant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If only OSCARS ARE FOR THE BIRDS were a phrase in usage ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedball_%28drug%29\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Jon_Voight_2012.jpg/440px-Jon_Voight_2012.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:188px\" title=\"Voight, player of LUKE MARTIN\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I did enjoy the bonuses Peter added. TRIAMINIC, MASERATIS, BOND PAPER, even LABRADOR with its beautiful &quot;chocolate-coated&quot; clue. Even ARM CURL, TOM KITE, EXURBIA = fun for me to uncover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of that &quot;chocolate-coated&quot; LABRADOR, awesome tie-in with the ENAMEL clue. Different kind of &quot;canine&quot; (tooth) coating!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A third fantastic clue in BAMBI, the symbol of gentle innocence. The movie is surprisingly heartbreaking (Try explaining what happens to BAMBI&#39;s MOM to your three-year old, though.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My wife stopped doing <a href=\"http://www.fireballcrosswords.com/\">Peter&#39;s Fireball puzzles</a>, because they tend to contain so many esoteric proper names, sometimes making her feel like the grids were unsolvable. I wouldn&#39;t go that far &mdash; I still enjoy them, although I do encounter some grids I just can&#39;t finish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think educated solvers ought to know MASERATIS, but TRIAMINIC might be a toughie. ABIDJAN, too. And ELOI &hellip; huh. I felt like all crossings were ultimately solvable, but it did give the puzzle an esoteric feel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with ERN, ALENE, ONE A, AGIN, it wasn&#39;t my favorite of Peter&#39;s grid executions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(People say RIDIC now? Is that a thing? Sigh. That&#39;s just ridic.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a constructor, I can understand the allure of the interlock &mdash; so fortuitous when that happens! &mdash; but I think a much smoother grid might have been possible with a more traditional 10 / 11 / 15 / 11 / 10 (all-across) layout.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>I was listening to a podcast on which the name CLARICE STARLING was mentioned. My ears pricked up. That&#39;s a name that ends in a bird, and it&#39;s 15 letters. I wondered how many other celebrities had bird last names. Before I got too far, I thought I should check to see if the theme had been done before. It had, many times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In CrosSynergy on 1/1/01, Frank Longo had TONY HAWK, TOM KITE, PAMELA SUE MARTIN, CHRISTOPHER WREN, JOHN JAY, and RITA DOVE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Los Angeles Times on 10/23/02, Denise M. Neuendorf had SHERYL CROW, TOM KITE, JONATHAN SWIFT, JOHN JAY, and PETER FINCH.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the New York Times on <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=3/15/2005\">3/15/05</a>, Gail Grabowski had HART CRANE, SHERYL CROW, EDDY RAVEN, JOHN JAY, and PETER FINCH.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the New York Times on <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=8/23/2006\">8/23/06</a>, Kevan Choset had CLARICE STARLING, PETER FINCH, SHERYL CROW, CHRISTOPHER WREN, and the explainer entry LARRY BIRD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in the New York Times on <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=5/10/2016\">5/10/16</a>, David Kwong had EARL WEAVER, JOHN JAY, TONY HAWK, HART CRANE, TOM SWIFT, PETER FINCH, and the explainer entry BIRDMAN.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI needed something to make it different. I thought that maybe I could limit myself to fictional characters. In addition to the ones I used, I had Ichabod Crane, Frasier Crane, Atticus Finch and Jem Finch, Hudson Hawk, Bella Swan, Christopher Robin, and the &quot;cuckoo&quot; Pigeon sisters from &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;: Gwendolyn and Cecily Pigeon. I noticed a lot of these were movie characters and then noticed that many were nominated for Oscars. So I went through all lists of Oscar-nominated roles to see if that would work, and I had success. I got lucky with how they were able to cross each other.</p>"]}]}}
