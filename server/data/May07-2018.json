complain when I use the word SHIM. It&#39;s baffling to me &mdash; just like any good mechanical engineer, I used to carry aluminum SHIM stock in my back pocket in case something needed to be leveled. That rickety table? SHIMmed! Someone need something wedged open? SHIMmed!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espadrille\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Mare_de_D%C3%A9u_de_la_Salut_15.jpg/440px-Mare_de_D%C3%A9u_de_la_Salut_15.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:left; height:250px; margin:6px 12px 6px 0px; width:140px\" title=\"This is an ESPADRILLE?\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, I&#39;m weird.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot packed into the TOOL BOX today. Most felt apt, but I scoffed at people having TAPE and SHIM stock in their TOOLBOXes. Everyone knows that pockets are where you put SHIM stock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wait. You&#39;re still reading? Amazing!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoyed some of the finds, SCREW in GROUND<strong>SCREW</strong> delightful. NAIL across ALVI<strong>N AIL</strong>EY, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will has asked me to avoid things like TUNA SA<strong>SHIM</strong>I, where the TUNA part of the answer feels unused. I don&#39;t always agree, but in this case, I&#39;d have preferred something like WI<strong>SH I M</strong>AY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or, removing SHIM completely from the theme. Much to this mech E&#39;s dismay, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s nearly as well known as DRILL or NAIL or SCREW.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ESPADRILLE is an interesting word. I didn&#39;t know it, but it seems like something an educated solver ought to be able to piece together through common letter sequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&#39;t always appreciate themer interlock, but I thought it was neat to have ALVIN AILEY / STAYS AWAY and ESPADRILLE / EAT A PEACH knit together. Not often that you see it in a Monday puzzle, so that was cool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the whole, all the objects strewn about gave the puzzle an overly chaotic feel to me. But upon further thought, it seems appropriate to a TOOLBOX. There&#39;s a ton of stuff crammed haphazardly into mine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, I might have preferred just four objects (deleting TAPE and SHIM) to make the grid more Mondayesque, getting rid of the OLA / APLEA, ORLON ESTER glue that&#39;s not friendly to newer solvers.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>I had been working on a puzzle with a musical theme, and my husband, &quot;helpful&quot; as always, had been suggesting all kinds of words that I just had to include. One was &quot;Oscar Hammerstein.&quot; Now, that puzzle was already very difficult to compose, with all kinds of constraints, so I just laughed. &quot;It&#39;s not that easy, you know,&quot; I told him. However, there was a hammer, just there. So, I put aside the musical idea and set to work on this toolbox puzzle &ndash; not that Oscar Hammerstein had any more luck making it into this puzzle than into the first one.</p>"]}
