Getting DART GUN, EGO TRIP, EASY RIDER, and THE BEEB (nickname for BBC) running through it makes it outstanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voodoo_doll\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Doll_with_pins_in_it%2C_Museum_of_Witchcraft.jpg/440px-Doll_with_pins_in_it%2C_Museum_of_Witchcraft.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:187px\" title=\"Those are some major sticking points!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stairstacks like this depend on the NW / SE corners to give extra sizzle, and Peter delivers on both counts. VOODOO DOLL was my favorite entry, and the awesome &quot;sticking point&quot; clue made it even better. POWER LEVEL was a fun one for this huge &quot;Clash Royale&quot; player (giant + night witch is my deck of choice).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not as wild about TAKE AIM AT in the other corner &mdash; felt more neutral than an asset, given that added preposition &mdash; but ONE AT A TIME makes me imagine some poor bureaucrat imploring people to wait. And BRAKE FLUID is pretty good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stairstack puzzles can finally eke out a bit more juice in the SW / NE corners, but this is a tough task, given that these corners are already constrained by that middle stair stack. CAPITAL M was good, especially since it misdirects to the ENVELOPE in the Gmail logo &mdash; sneaky that both are eight letters! &mdash; but DIGICAMS and LOAN OUT didn&#39;t do much for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I normally love THE FEDS as an entry, but the minor dupe with THE BEEB nearby felt inelegant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such a smooth puzzle, maybe just INCANT a bit of an odd duck. So few constructors can get so much snazz packed into a 68-word grid without relying on any short crossword glue as a crutch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, another beaut from one of my favorite themeless constructors.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>This grid layout has become something of a go-to for me, with <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=2/13/2016\">a similar one published about two years ago</a> and another being written as we speak. It offers good opportunities for a variety of stacks, is reasonably wide-open, and can accommodate edits without sacrificing the entire puzzle. This one appears to hold up even years after its original creation, so it&#39;ll likely continue to be a staple on down the line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I thought I&#39;d struck gold with my original clue for 11-Down [&quot;Family Matters&quot; central character], but the whole &quot;character&quot; bit of wordplay for CAPITAL_ entries is old-hat at this point, so the revised clue referencing the Gmail logo is a nice alternative. Lots of other improvements in the clue department as well, with my favorite probably being 54-Across.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hope everyone enjoys!</p>"]}]}}
