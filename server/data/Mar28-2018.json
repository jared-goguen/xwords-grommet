ended in T? Who would have even thought to search for those? I can imagine a constructor coming up with it if there was an actual term like FINALTIES. (T RUMP isn&#39;t bad though!) So kudos to Peter for uncovering a nice concept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Adele_H.\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cb/L%27histoire_d%27Ad%C3%A8le_H..jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:249px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:189px\" title=\"Ah, It's ADELE H, not ADELEH!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oof, I had issues with the gridwork, though. I did love KNEE BRACES, SCALE MODEL, GOES STAG, even APOGEE. Great stuff, helping to enhance my solve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&#39;s so tough to fill a themeless-level grid (72 words) with regular theme density, color, and smoothness. It&#39;s an unholy trinity &ndash; you can pick two of those, but you can&#39;t achieve all three. I thought the puzzle suffered in the smoothness category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The worst for me as the LILMO / ADELEH crossing. I guessed correctly at this square, but I can see a case for many other letters seeming right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Jim thought ADELE H ought to be a gimme, a famous work of one of the most impactful movie directors in history. So perhaps I ought to have known that one? Still undecided.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there was ASON. SESS. IAL. AGUE. FARO crossing KAHANE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Constructors have to make trade-off calls on every puzzle they build. Going to a low word count didn&#39;t work for me in this one; the high prices to pay = not my cup of T.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BTW, all the clues end in T. That didn&#39;t do much for me, since lots and lots of words end in T, making the feat not so impressive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I did enjoy the themer findings, the concept itself a delighT.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>The idea for this puzzle came while testing a hangman book for Puzzlewright. The answer to one puzzle was LAST BUT NOT LEAST, and when I noticed that each of the four words ended with a T, I thought I could maybe make a theme out of that. I tried to find other letters that ended all the words in a four-word phrase but got nowhere fast. So then I went back to T and tried to come up with three-word phrases with the same trait. Having three three-word phrases followed by LAST BUT NOT LEAST, which describes itself, felt quite apt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having no other T&#39;s anywhere in the grid was, I felt, important. Will Shortz wasn&#39;t particular about that, but asked if I could make every clue end in a T. Having made <a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date%3D3/2/2017&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1522010729454000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEiWkjc32tZFxO8ftYF9MN8iDA3NQ\" href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=3/2/2017\" style=\"color:#1155cc\">a puzzle where every clue was a double dactyl</a>, I figured (correctly) that making one where all the clues ended in a T would be no sweat. Using no other T&#39;s in the grid was a much tougher constraint. But for the clues ending in T, I had the additional self-imposed rule that all of the T-ending words had to be different. With that rule, it was no easy feat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI had KEGEL (Exercise-developing gynecologist) at 32-Across, making 21-Down ASOK (Intern in &quot;Dilbert&quot;) and 33-Down LAT (Muscle next to a delt). I prefer the ASOK/KEGEL crossing to the partial at 21-Down, but &quot;chacun &agrave; son go&ucirc;t,&quot; right?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere&#39;s a little puzzle to think about. When a puzzle gets collected into a book, a title often gets added, so I like to suggest a title when I submit it. Can you guess the title I have in mind for this puzzle from this hint? Take the last name of a U.S. president. Add a space so that the last four letters are separate from the first. Still don&#39;t have it at this point? He&#39;s a president who likes to tweet.</p>"]}]}}
