I would expect the vast majority of NYT readers would know Seiji Ozawa \"off the top.\" Neither Jeff nor I know for sure."],"JeffNotes":["<p>I love it when I see a theme I can&#39;t even imagine dreaming up. Take Greek letters, stick a bunch together, then parse them in odd ways to come up with creatively kooky answers? Fantastic! I had the hardest time figuring out LAMBDA TAU = LAMB DATA U, but what a hilarious image. Made me think of &quot;Hamburger U,&quot; McDonald&#39;s training grounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Flock_of_sheep.jpg/480px-Flock_of_sheep.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:left; height:250px; margin:6px 12px 6px 0px; width:164px\" title=\"Roll call for LAMB DATA U\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And CHI PSI ZETA XI = CHIP SIZE TAXI? That&#39;s an incredibly cool find. A funny one, too!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THETA OMICRON = THE TAU MICRON sounds like a Stephen Hawking book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wasn&#39;t as hot on BETA PI ETA = BET A PIETA, as the spacing changes weren&#39;t as unpredictable. Still, the concept of betting a pieta (depiction of Mary and Jesus) is evocative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The theme was so interesting that I wanted so badly to give it the POW! The fill didn&#39;t quite match in excellence, though. TABAC at 1-Down = sigh. ALEPH at 2-Down confuses the theme a bit. I&#39;d much rather keep all other letters out of the fill for this theme, no matter what language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ICAL crossing SECY &ndash; neither is a puzzle-killer, but they sure ain&#39;t good. Crossing them draws extra attention to these dabs of crossword glue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OZAWA / TAZO is worse to me. I don&#39;t think educated solvers should be expected to know OZAWA off the top &mdash; I played in orchestras for 20 years, and I learned him only from crosswords &mdash; and while TAZO was once owned by Starbucks, I wonder if it&#39;s a big enough brand to demand solvers&#39; attention. Crossing them doesn&#39;t feel fair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toss in some ARNO, OCTA, TUE, and I just couldn&#39;t do it. So close to a POW! on your debut, Dominick! I think if you&#39;d left out ITS ALL GREEK TO ME, I still would have understood the theme, and you could have smoothed and snazzified your grid. Not a whole lot of room for bonuses, as it is &mdash; HAIRIEST and AMATEURS are fine, but not outstanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve seen plenty of crosswords around ITS ALL GREEK TO ME, but this one was different. I like different.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>I am delighted to have this crossword appear in the New York Times. I would like to thank Will and the other editors for helping to bring the puzzle into shape, and especially for having the good sense to nix a theme entry to which I had become so foolishly endeared that I willfully overlooked the absurd difficulty in parsing it: OMEGAALPHA [&quot;Behold, the enormous French mountain? Yeah, right!&quot;?]</p>"]}]}}
