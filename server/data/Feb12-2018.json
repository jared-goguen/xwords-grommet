It seems a little miraculous that something as long as DISCOVER could span two words of a normal phrase. AMEX is shorter and thus easier to work with, but that X ratchets up the difficulty. And even VISA&#39;s VI or VIS is no joke. Three great discoveries made for a great theme, CARDHOLDER a perfect revealer. Delightful!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discover_Card\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Discover_Card_logo.svg/350px-Discover_Card_logo.svg.png\" style=\"border:none; float:right; height:36px; margin:6px 0px 12px 20px; width:220px\" title=\"Neat DISCOVERies!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Made me wonder what other possible themers were out there. <strong>VIS A</strong> VIS is the obvious one, but that doesn&#39;t hold a candle to the awesome ELVIS AND ME. There&#39;s NO<strong>VI SA</strong>D, the Serbian city, but that seems hardly crossworthy &mdash; not novice friendly, in any case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And such a wealth of rare letters in the fill, (mostly) worked in so smoothly! Two Js, three Xs, two Zs, that&#39;s way more than a usual puzzle contains. ITEN was a price to pay for the two Zs in OZZY, but I was okay with that trade-off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only hesitation I had before giving this the POW! &hellip; two crossings that I worried might trip up newer solvers:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>INI / SAW II. Not a great way to start the puzzle, especially cluing INI as a person with a hit from over 20 years ago. But what else could that be? VNI would be an unlikely name, and SAW VI &hellip; please, somebody make the franchise stop!</li>\r\n\t<li>OJAY / CADY. I think educated solvers ought to at least have heard of Elizabeth CADY Stanton, but I could understand if someone couldn&#39;t remember the spelling. OJAI / CADI? Not nearly as correct-looking to my eye, but there is a city named OJAI, so I&#39;d be sympathetic to that error, chalking it up to Mike&#39;s fault, not the solver&#39;s.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>So the J in AJAX is the one rare letter that I didn&#39;t think was worth it, leading to a tough crossing that might trip up newer solvers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But overall, I loved the theme DISCOVERies (I did wonder about MASTERCARD to get the full set, but what are you gonna do?) and 95% of the grid execution.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>Well, it&#39;s been a while, but it&#39;s good to be back. This is my fifth puzzle &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=1/29/2014\">my last one</a> ran a little over four years ago, <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=7/14/2010\">my first one</a> ran in 2010. At this rate, I&#39;ll have joined the exclusive &quot;Ten Club&quot; in 2026.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot has happened since my last publication &mdash; I became a father, I made my way on air as a news anchor and sports announcer, and I met Will Shortz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being that I have more on my plate nowadays, I don&#39;t submit as often as I once did, but if a good idea crosses my mind, I will try to put it to paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This idea just sort of popped into my head one day. I thought it was worth trying it out, but admittedly, I had trouble figuring out theme answers for VISA and DISCOVER. Maybe ELVIS ANDRUS for VISA? Maybe if this were a crossword in Baseball Digest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Truth is, the suggestion box under the Google search bar is what really helped me with these two. I began typing &quot;ELVIS A&quot; to see what would come up and did the same for &quot;DISCO VER.&quot; The results I found seemed like legit answers, and Will apparently agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of cool things I realized recently with this puzzle: by total coincidence, the TEX in VORTEX crosses into RITTER, which is neat. Also by total coincidence, PAPI is at 34-Down, and Big Papi&#39;s number was 34 (my favorite jersey number).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, and I&#39;m sure there will be nitpickers out there who will find fault in my lack of MASTERCARD, but that just wasn&#39;t gonna happen. As the commercial says, that&#39;s for everything else.</p>"]}]}}
