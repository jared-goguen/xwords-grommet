I could not figure out what was going on. I had things like HURRICANE ___, and knew it had to be some sort of rebus. But what? And was I really supposed to remember the names of various hurricanes, for goodness sakes?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Calrissian\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cb/Lando6-2.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:left; height:130px; margin:6px 12px 6px 0px; width:220px\" title=\"LO, CALRISSIAN! Er, LANDO.\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wow, did everything flip for me when I *finally* got it. HURRICANE SANDY got reimagined as HURRICANE S and Y, the crossing answer using just the SY to complete NOT AS EA(SY). Mind-bendingly clever! Sam does make some PANDA puzzles &ndash; P and A for Puns and Anagrams &mdash; so that should have nudged me toward the puzzle theme much earlier. D&#39;oh!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jim once mentioned that he loved themes that were necessary to understand to solve the puzzle. I sort of got what he meant, but that notion fully clicked for me today, unable to figure out SANDY until I grokked the theme. Very cool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would have thought that the very limiting constraint of &quot;word must follow the X AND Y pattern&quot; would have produced some boring themers. Not so! LANDO CALRISSIAN, PANDA EXPRESS, YANKEE DOODLE DANDY made me a KID IN A CANDY STORE. Wonderful job of uncovering so many great phrases while adhering to a tough constraint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of minor dings here and there, most notably the GMEN / YEAH MAN dupe (crossing each other, oof), but I didn&#39;t mind at all because I was so delighted by the innovative theme. (Sorry Sam, I&#39;m with Will and Joel on the iffiness of RIGHT FIT.) Along with super solid execution &ndash; some nice COMO ESTA, LEMME SEE, GO STEADY, AVE MARIA bonuses, with a pretty small amount of ignorable TGI, ECTO, DECI gluey bits &ndash; it was a big winner for me. POW!</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>No April fooling; one week after my A.C.P.T. playoff puzzle, I actually have a Sunday publication in the Times! This achievement has eluded me for years, so I&#39;m super stoked to finally <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Cycle\">&quot;hit for the cycle&quot;</a> on being published throughout the week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/images/bonus/20180328original.jpg\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/images/bonus/20180328original.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:left; height:233px; margin:6px 12px 6px 0px; width:220px\" title=\"Sam's original Thursday grid\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Funny enough, I originally built the 15x16 grid below (shown at left), intending the puzzle for a Thursday. I didn&#39;t want a single rebus-ized letter to be repeated anywhere else, and figured the special squares should always appear at the ends of answers. My only hitch was whether or not the last example, THERE&#39;S NOT A LOT I CAN DO, was an unfair inconsistency or a fun final twist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I showed it all to Joel on a Subway ride, he not only thought the former was true, but that my other restrictions were unnecessary. He wondered if the idea would be best in Sunday form altogether, and it took me maybe a half-second to excitedly agree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I may say, I&#39;m super thrilled with how this thing turned out. These theme answers seem like a fun set in themselves, and I&#39;m glad to have worked in four sets of triple-stacked 8s as well as fun bonuses in YEAH MAN, BAR SOAP and NICE DAY. The clues for TOBACCO and OLES feel like some of my best work, and even the angles for OMAN, ALABAMA and AVE MARIA have a fresh feel. Did anyone catch the &quot;It&#39;s lit&quot; and &quot;Totally, bro&quot; one-two punch? That was &mdash; *sigh* &mdash; very intentional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Curious to see how people feel about RIGHT FIT. I could&#39;ve easily made this RIGHTFUL, but I thought the former was a interesting, lexical phrase. You hope that a new setting is the right fit for someone, no? Or, as I clued it, that your clothing has the right fit on you? Two certain people that I work with closely seem to feel otherwise ... so I guess I should brace myself for an earful in the comments :)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happy solving, and may this puzzle not fool you as much as yesterday&#39;s early surprise!</p>"]}]}}
