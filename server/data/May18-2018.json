loved this one. I&#39;m a sucker for giant middle swaths of white like this one. Lots of themeless constructors &quot;stair stack&quot; three long answers in this manner, but how many even attempt five? To pull it off with great answers &ndash; PRIDE PARADE and SOUND MIXERS are fantastic &ndash; <em>and</em> run four more snazzy answers through them?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CORPSE POSE was always my favorite part of yoga, basically lying on the ground and falling asleep. Along with WATER TAXIS, WINEMAKING, RARE JEWELS, this middle section is a rare jewel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orionids\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Two_orionids_and_milky_way.jpg/240px-Two_orionids_and_milky_way.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:203px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"Star-studded picture for a star-studded puzzle!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some strong work in the NW / SE corners, too. NOT ONE IOTA / STARTER SET / AIR POPS is pretty darn nice. SAY WHEN, NAME CALLER too?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JEEZ, there&#39;s so much goodness packed in!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yikes, even the remaining corners &ndash; which often end up dull in these stair stack themelesses &ndash; had some ORIONIDS (think of ORION), BANSHEE, OH STOP, TWO PAIR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it was all SOLVABLE, without running into much of any crossword glue! I squint a bit at TABU, but even that seems reasonable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, HYSONS in the plural felt odd. HYSON in the singular too!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regular readers will be able to guess the main nit I had: the segmentation. The NW and SE were nearly cut off from the middle, potentially stranding solvers in one of the puzzle&#39;s subsections. But there are two entries connecting each corner to the middle, so it&#39;s passable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grid construction is much easier when using this type of segmentation since you can (sort of) independently work on each subsection. But when it allows such amazing results, I&#39;m okay looking the other way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Would have been the POW! for most weeks this year so far. It&#39;s just that darn good.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>This puzzle is somewhat of a tribute to Patrick Berry&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=1/10/2014\">Friday puzzle from January 10, 2014.</a> I fell in love with his puzzle&#39;s wide open grid, and it was after doing this puzzle that I decided to try making themeless puzzles myself. My version, now several years, later has a similar layout to his, with a &quot;gaping maw&quot; (as I affectionately like to call it) in the middle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It took a lot of trial and error, as you might imagine, to fill the center. My goal was to make each of the longer entries in both the 5 stacked Across answers and the 4 interlocking Down answers interesting, as well as stay away from proper names, as I had had a habit of overusing them. Overall I&#39;m very satisfied with the result here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My effort to also keep the corners wide open came with some sacrifices. The NW feels a bit like Jenga with all of those interlocking shorter words, and the SE has the unfortunate plural HYSONS, which I only personally accepted because I had actually had hyson tea before. It allowed me to keep RARE JEWELS though, so looking back I still think it&#39;s justified. Even so, it may have been worth adding an extra black square to these corners to give some more wiggle room...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoy making lower word count themeless puzzles, so I&#39;ll probably stick with these types for a while. Hope you enjoy!</p>"]}]}}
