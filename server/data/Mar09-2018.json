Sounds like something straight out of &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;! Maybe I&#39;m not familiar with the term because researching what it meant crEEEEPED ME OUT SPIDERS AND BEDBUGS AND ICK!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_and_Gromit\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ec/Wallace_and_gromit.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:164px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"Cheese, Gromit!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All shuddering aside, the phrase-that-shall-remain-unspoken crossing ONE DAY AT A TIME made for a solid spine to the puzzle. Love KABLOOEY too, although I confidently plunked in KABLOOIE. Either makes for a happy Jeff &ndash; such a funny word.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Themelesses built off of interlocking central spines can be tough, because each of the usual stacks of long entries now has to work with those spines. I thought Neville and Doug did a nice job with the NW, getting RAT PACK, EURASIAN, and ABU DHABI intersecting with KABLOOEY / NIGHTMARE FUEL. Solid result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A bit of wastage in the other long slots though, in ORDER OUT and DETECTS (not super interesting), ADO ANNIE (from &hellip; &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;?), and even MONTANA. As much as I love #16 &ndash; tons of great memories watching the Niners as a kid &ndash; just a last name isn&#39;t nearly as great as working in the full JOE MONTANA. It&#39;s pretty common to have some LUKEWARM long entries in themelesses built off intersecting spines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I appreciated that the short fill did its job, mostly staying out of the way (ARE WE, I see you). And even chipping in, with a great clue for EDSEL &ndash; &quot;The thrill starts with the grille&quot; is an awesome way to add color to a puzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And finally, the mid-length stuff helped raise the puzzle&#39;s impact for me, NBA JAM a favorite of my youth. Along with GROMIT (cheese!), EXOTICA, a TRUISM, and some PROZAC, the mid-length fill was in many ways the star of the show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot to enjoy out of this one. If more of the longer slots had sizzled, this would have been in POW! contention.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>We&#39;re both big fans of the Golden Age of Television, so we racked our brains to find some way to sneak a classic TV reference into this puzzle. Should we use <em>Simon &amp; Simon</em> or <em>Riptide</em> in the DETECTS clue? How about the &quot;L&quot; monograms that were SEWN ON all of Laverne DeFazio&#39;s tops? We could&#39;ve asked which cop show was the LEAD-IN to <em>The Love Boat</em> for four seasons. (<em>T.J. Hooker</em>. Duh.) Or maybe a shoutout to our favorite NEMESES, Jo and Blair from the <em>Facts of Life</em>. In the end, we decided there was simply no elegant way to refer to a &#39;70s-&#39;80s sitcom that ran for 9 seasons on CBS and was recently rebooted as a successful Netflix series. Maybe next puzzle!</p>"]}]}}
