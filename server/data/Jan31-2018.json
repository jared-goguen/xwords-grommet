\"How I Met Your Mother,\" as well as the writer/director of two films (to date), working together with Jeff Chen, a writer in Seattle. This is Jeff's 80th crossword for The Times.<br />     More information about the making of today's puzzle appears in the Times's daily crossword column (nytimes.com/column/wordplay)."],"JeffNotes":["<p>Letter(s)-addition puzzles usually have all sorts of themer possibilities, and OM is a pretty common doublet. So it came as a surprise to me that there were so few possibilities. I thought three themers (in addition to PREMEDITATION) would feel thin, so thankfully, there were just enough that worked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Vogue%2C_portada_de_mayo_de_1917.jpg/340px-Vogue%2C_portada_de_mayo_de_1917.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:left; height:249px; margin:6px 12px 6px 0px; width:191px\" title=\"OMENous!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No constructor is dumb enough to use themers of length 12 / 11 / 9 / 11 / 12 (PREMEDITATED had to come last). It&#39;s completely inflexible, forces themers to be squished up and causes all sorts of headaches in the middle of your puzzle. No matter how hard we tried though, we couldn&#39;t come up with any shorter themers as replacements. Drat!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were so few possibilities in the layout that I thought the concept might be dead (or necessitate a larger grid). Thankfully, the one you see seemed to work out &hellip; although it had a ridiculous number of long slots everywhere in the grid. It felt like there was no way it could all work out, especially given the pesky J within OMITS NO JOKE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But somehow, it did! There was precisely one possible skeleton &mdash; I like to have at least 5-10 to consider &mdash; so it was a minor miracle. NET JUDGES isn&#39;t something I strive to incorporate usually, but man, did it save our butts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn&#39;t intend to make it a low word-count puzzle, but that&#39;s what it ended up having to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Josh helped figure out what the best options for each corner might be. Fun to do the optometry test &mdash; which is more clean and colorful, A, B, or C? Since Josh is doing plays these days, we prioritized getting play-related material in. Glad to work in OFFSTAGE right at 1-A.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p><strong>JEFF: </strong>Very cool to get a chance to work with Josh! My wife had just listened to a <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/josh-radnor-moving-past-met-mother-meditation-grounded/story?id=44403797\">podcast about meditation in which he was featured</a>, so that sparked conversation. Somehow, meditation got linked to premeditation &mdash; or PRE-meditation &mdash; and off we went. OM!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I like one of his quotes: &quot;&#39;How I Met Your Mother&#39; might be my great popular success, I mean, it might be. I hope it&#39;s not. I suspect I&#39;ll have some other things that will be seen and noticed, [but] I&#39;m just going to keep making things that light me up.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Love that attitude. I&#39;m looking forward to hearing a lot more about Josh&#39;s projects in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Co-created!
