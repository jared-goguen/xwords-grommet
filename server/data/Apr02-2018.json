listing of its famous landmarks. I visited Paris maybe 30 years ago &mdash; so much to see. THE LOUVRE and NOTRE DAME were amazing. I missed PONT NEUF, but apparently, it&#39;s quite beautiful as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pont_Neuf\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Pont_Neuf_at_Sunset.jpg/440px-Pont_Neuf_at_Sunset.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:165px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"Wish I had seen this when I was there. Breathtaking!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s hard to make a list puzzle stand out. More often than not, it comes across like reading a Wikipedia article &mdash; not super interesting. An extra level, whether it be theme tightness, a visual element, or a novel twist, can help it become memorable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tightness? That would be if there were a famous tourist term called &quot;the five French landmarks,&quot; and all five were included. In today&#39;s puzzle, why PONT NEUF and not the ARC DE TRIOMPHE? Why the SORBONNE (without THE, like in THE LOUVRE, too) and not MONTMARTRE? These feel like arbitrary choices based solely on the need for crossword symmetry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visual element? Perhaps if the EIFFEL TOWEL had been oriented vertically? Or each monument was in the same geographical location as in a map of PARIS?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Novel twist? You tell me! Ideas?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&#39;t totally agree with Jason on the fill being solid. Granted, I have a very high bar for Monday puzzles. I think they need to be warm and welcoming to newcomers, allowing for a beautiful feeling of HELL YEAH, I CONQUERED A NYT CROSSWORD! Ultimately, everything in the grid is fair, but I can imagine newer solvers staring at FES, simultaneously at PONT NEUF, and wondering what the heck they had gotten themselves into.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SSR is a gluey bit I might move to &quot;puzzle-killer&quot; status. USSR, sure, but SSR feels like something constructors use when desperate. DES, ENE, ESTD, TOR are much more minor to me, but still, too much in one Monday puzzle. Yes, six themers is a feat, but a feat that usually comes with too many compromises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending with just PARIS, instead of PARIS FRANCE, could have helped. Probably not many people thinking about Paris, Idaho after they uncover the EIFFEL TOWER.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, I hope everyone gets a chance to see PARIS one day. I liked how the puzzle reminded me of my short time there.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>I wanted to get a good number and variety of landmarks in this puzzle, and with five well-known places plus a revealer, I think I did just that. The fill is solid, with SAFETY NET, KING MINOS, and NERF GUN providing some pizzazz. Also, I&#39;ve never been to Paris.</p>"]}
