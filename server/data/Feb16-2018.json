href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=10/9/2015&amp;g=50&amp;d=A\">TOPLESS DANCERS</a>, I was nervous after uncovering PENTHOUSE &hellip; thankfully it was PENTHOUSE SUITE! Whew. That&#39;s a great feature entry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedball_%28drug%29\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Cocaine3.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:228px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:166px\" title=\"Oh, THAT'S a SPEEDBALL? Yikes!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wasn&#39;t as hot on YOGURT SMOOTHIE &ndash; I drink a lot of fruit smoothies, protein shakes, etc., but YOGURT SMOOTHIE didn&#39;t immediately ring a bell. Still, it was obvious enough &hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&hellip; what else goes into a YOGURT SMOOTHIE, though? Isn&#39;t it just yogurt? Why don&#39;t they just call it &quot;yogurt&quot;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tough to build a themeless around 14s, but David did a nice job of it. Classic approach, putting them in rows 4 and 12, still allowing him to build triple-stacks in the NW and SE corners, by placing a black square between TROI and ABUT. Both corners turned out pretty nice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BOX CAMERA / SPEEDBALL / PENTHOUSE SUITE is a great triplet. I was all set to go gung-ho on the praise for it &hellip; then I realized what a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedball_%28drug%29\">SPEEDBALL</a> is. Yikes!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then I hit the AMBOY / ROY crossing. I had to debate ROD, ROG, ROS, ROC, ROB, ROY. Ultimately, the &quot;king&quot; etymology made ROY win out, but I think a more straightforward clue for ROY would have been better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SE corner had a solid stack, too, with INAMORATA such a fancy-pants (in a good way!) term for &quot;lover.&quot; PIXELATED was a fun term too &hellip; but oof, I don&#39;t want my crosswords to make me imagine pics that men seem to frequently text &hellip; let&#39;s leave it at that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EADS / INAMORATA did seem iffy, but I *think* educated solvers ought to be able to work out that A ending letter, based on what they know of Romance languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Get it, romance?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*rimshot*</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, I&#39;m sympathetic if you got that square wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, good use of his long slots, NEAT AS A PIN / TATE MODERN my favorite entries of the grid, what with their timeless feel. Not keen on the AGENA &hellip; rocket? &hellip; but those EADS AMBOY TROI dabs of crossword glue did enable a lot of good entries.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>This is the second of two themelesses accepted in 2014 that I &quot;revitalized&quot; a few months ago (<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date%3D12/29/2017&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1518199691818000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEC6HnyKTNGYTkt8IhPSp1GTa-e8A\" href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=12/29/2017\">the first</a> was published December 29). Not as much zip in this one as I&#39;d strive to include nowadays, but I like the overall smoothness. It&#39;s like a YOGURT SMOOTHIE, with just a couple of raspberries that didn&#39;t defrost mixed in (I&#39;m looking at you, AGENA and ONE NO!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;d say the highlight of the puzzle is the clues. My favorite David Steinberg Original&reg; is [Like privates, often] for PIXELATED. Brings back memories of what was on my mind when I was 17 ;).</p>"]}
