(KICKS is what the young kids call shoes these days. Well, not anymore now that I&#39;ve started to use the term myself.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_shoe\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Ellie821heel.JPG/440px-Ellie821heel.JPG\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:146px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"Life of the PARTY!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such a hilarious image of a cat burglar, walking upside-down across a ceiling in fashionable SUCTION shoes. Love it! And PLATFORM shoes no doubt make you the life of the PARTY. Great repurposing of the common political phrase, PARTY PLATFORM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WATER MOCCASINS wasn&#39;t as amusing to me, as you can&#39;t see synchro swimmers&#39; feet that much, but it worked well as a kooky redefining of the moccasin snakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I liked the theme notion so much that I would have loved a fifth themer. But not sure what that could be &ndash; maybe FLATS, in TORTILLA FLATS? HEELS, in TAR HEELS?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Totally fine to stick to four though, especially if you&#39;re going to buckle down and make the grid great. So much room for bonuses in the fill and Sam and Tracy didn&#39;t disappoint. MEMOIRS, TROUNCED, G FORCES, HOOPLA, SUPERSIZED? WHAT A TREAT! Sam and Tracy, YOU WIN!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note how well they spaced out their bonus fill, alternating up / down, trying to keep them as far apart as possible. Generally speaking, the less long bonuses have to interact with each other, the easier it is to fill the grid smoothly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And a nice and smooth product, indeed. I might have tried harder to avoid EMIR and EDDA for an early-week puzzle, but I can see the case for those being terms an educated solver ought to know. Short gluey entries are usually easier to ignore, anyway, than longer globs. Something like GO NOW is a bit harder to let slide &mdash; seems a bit awkward, doesn&#39;t it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But those are minor nits. An early-week puzzle that both gives me this many kicks, and demonstrates high craftsmanship, easily deserves a POW!</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p><strong>SAM:</strong> I came across the phrase JUST FOR KICKS and thought it would be a great name for a shoe store. That&#39;s when the theme idea for this puzzle hit. I had wanted to collaborate with Tracy for some time, so I sent her a set of proposed theme entries and asked if she wanted to join in the fun. Happily, she agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TRACY:</strong> I tackled the initial challenge of the 12-14-14-12 grid. Together, we went through several iterations of the grid, opening up 4- and 31-down for some colorful long down entries, but having to deal with some frustrating fill constraints in two areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SAM:</strong> I really admired Tracy&#39;s construction. As she says, a grid built around two 12s and two 14s imposes significant constraints. She made it look easy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TRACY:</strong> With the exception of EDDA, I think we were both happy with the finished puzzle and were thrilled when we got the yes this past February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SAM:</strong> Here&#39;s hoping the next royal baby is named Edda!</p>"]}]}}
