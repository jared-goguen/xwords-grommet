I felt it had a lot of potential, but I found it so hard to explain the theme. Let&#39;s see if I can do it without discombobulating everyone:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macarena_(song)\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/aa/MacarenaLosDelRio.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:220px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"Hard to imagine that this was once &quot;a thing&quot; ...\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Entries refer to other entries (1-Across is 12 DOWN, which points to the entry at 12-Down)</li>\r\n\t<li>The clue from one reference is the entry at the other reference</li>\r\n\t<li>Numbers are used, but as homophones in the crossing direction</li>\r\n\t<li>It&#39;s all tied together by 4WARDING ADDRESS</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Still with me? Didn&#39;t think so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, 1-Down isn&#39;t 1SIES, but ONESIES. 2-Down is 2TORED = TUTORED. And 1-Across is clued as [Ten cents], which is the entry at 12-Down. And 12 DOWN is the entry at 1-Across.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whew!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plenty of puzzles have used cross-referencing, numbers in grids, homophones, even clues duped as entries &mdash; but the combination feels like something different and unique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One point I made to Dan was that it would be a lot better if it weren&#39;t random entries that were duped from clue to entry. Why SEA COW, MACARENA, etc.? &quot;Just because they fit&quot; usually isn&#39;t a good enough rationale for me. It&#39;d be orders of magnitude harder &mdash; maybe impossible &mdash; to work in entries that hint at the puzzle&#39;s theme (maybe DUPLICATION, CLONING, EVIL TWIN, etc.). So I like the balance he achieved, giving us some snazzier answers in TEN CENTS and MACARENA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I liked a lot of the bonuses in the fill &mdash; TIME STAMP, STARTUP, TARANTINO, CREATINE. And Dan kept his short fill fairly smooth, a tough task given all the themers packed into the grid. SSRS and WIEN were cringe-y outliers, but ELL, NEV, PRES, SENS are mostly ignorable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would have liked more bonuses, as things like REANNEX, ENTERER, ALLOWED IN all felt neutral to negative, but that&#39;s tough to do given how much real estate the themers take up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, I appreciated the novelty of the solve. It felt different. I think different is a great thing for crosswords.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>Hello solvers! This is my second published puzzle, and I&#39;m pretty excited about it. I had the idea late last year in the context of &quot;pointers&quot; in computer programming: a chunk of memory that doesn&#39;t store relevant data itself but instead, points to another location in memory where the data can be found. Seemed an interesting concept to use as a trick in a crossword, so I got to work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While thinking of words with &quot;digit sounds&quot; in them to cross the location answers, 4WARD popped into my head, which led me to 4WARDING ADDRESS &mdash; a perfect metaphor, and it was 15 characters long. Eureka! The 4 and S both fitting into the xxACROSS answers was a nice bonus, and really tied the theme together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What made this a bear to construct was that only some digits work as sounds in other words, and adding or removing even a single black square could totally change the entries&#39; numbering. Furthermore, the &quot;forwarded&quot; answers had to be reasonably interesting on their own (thanks to Jeff Chen, who took a look at an early version, for pointing out the importance of that last bit). Put that all together, and you have a lot of constraints to deal with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It took a ton of work to get it into shape, but eventually, it was ready to submit. Will liked the concept, and after a bit more work it was approved. There was one significant editorial change worth mentioning: originally I had actual clues for the &quot;forwarded&quot; answers, marked with an asterisk, e.g. &quot;Granted access*&quot; at 38-Down instead of &quot;Allowed in&quot;. The destination locations were clued with just an arrow, and the revealer clue was &quot;Something to leave at the post office... or what the answers to the four starred clues each have&quot;. Will felt it would be a little too difficult to make that large a mental leap in solving, so it was changed to what you see now. I&#39;m happy with the result, and proud of the puzzle. Hope you enjoyed it!</p>"]}]}}
