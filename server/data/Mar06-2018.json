Nice and consistent theme, phrases in the form of (animal + movement). I loved CHICKEN RUN, by the maker of &quot;Wallace and Gromit,&quot; and BEAR CRAWL and TURKEY TROT are such fun terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_Run\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/00/Chicken_run_ver1.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:156px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"CHICKEN RUN\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>FROG MARCH &hellip; a bit off-putting, but colorful nonetheless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GOOSE STEP. Not sure a term so closely associated with the Nazis is something I want in my daily diversion. I might have chosen to leave it out, personally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another reason to leave it out &ndash; look how nicely BEAR CRAWL could slip into GOOSE STEP&#39;s spot &ndash; is that working with a middle 9-letter themer makes the construction SO much harder. With just four themers, you have so much flexibility. Pretty easy to produce a colorful and smooth grid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five themers, including a middle 9, is almost always going to require a couple of trade-offs. It creates all sorts of problems in the four corners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Start with ABBES to kick off the puzzle. Probably worth the nice ALFALFA, BARRIOS, BROKERS. It&#39;s super important to have a solid 1-Across since there&#39;s only one first impression you can make on your solver, but I think that NW corner is pretty good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the SE, was ALLSTAR worth the price of WBA, LOGE, ELLO, SRA? To me, probably not. But I&#39;d listen to arguments otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toss in some OSMIC, DES, ERGS, ETES &hellip; I&#39;d have liked a smoother result, given that it&#39;s an early-week theme. Eliminating a themer would have allowed for that, but more cheater squares could likely have helped too. I like Bruce&#39;s usage of black squares before BALD and after ERGS &ndash; that most certainly made the NE and SW corners smoother. Another pair of added black squares in the opposite corners could have been useful, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good debut, especially in terms of themer consistency. A couple of hiccups in execution.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>Finally! After five (or six?) submissions, I got Will&#39;s blessing. After just one, relatively straightforward, set of edits, it was ready to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The seed of this puzzle came from &quot;turkey trot&quot;, as I was considering participating in the annual Detroit Thanksgiving 5k race by that name. I didn&#39;t end up running, but I did get a good puzzle idea out of it! Soon I was wracking my brain for similar &quot;animal walk&quot; phrases. &quot;Bear crawl&quot; and &quot;frog march&quot; all came pretty quickly, plus they were a crossword-friendly 9 letters to boot! </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I knew I needed at least one more, or a revealer of some sort to put the puzzle into submission realm. I resorted to my old friend Google to search for animal phrases. &quot;Goose step&quot;, also at 9 letters worked well, but frankly &quot;Chicken Run&quot; was my least favorite as it did not seem as &quot;tight&quot; as the others since it was not something &quot;doable&quot; by a human &ndash; like the others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For my debut I was excited that Will used most of my fill, though probably less than half my clues. His cluing was certainly &quot;fresher&quot; than mine. I mean, &quot;Raiders of the Lost __&quot; ? That was just plain lazy. I love his replacement! After 35+ years of solving NYT puzzles, I am positively thrilled to finally join the club of constructors. One down, hopefully many more to go!</p>"]}]}}
