I enjoyed this one as a constructor, but surprisingly as a solver, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronda_Rousey\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Rrousey.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:left; height:250px; margin:6px 12px 6px 0px; width:108px\" title=\"Ronda ROUSEY\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had low expectations once I saw the huge OPEN floor PLAN of the grid, knowing that I&#39;d have to slog through some glue or weirdness. Pleasantly surprised at how much fun I had! It&#39;s unusual to get snazzy entries in a grid like this, so DRUM ROLL, ACQUIRED / TASTES, and GAZELLES all in a single quadrant made me smile right off the bat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DIVE BAR too? And HARANGUE? IV DRIP, MPEG FILE, even Ronda ROUSEY, CUSSER, WEASELED = fun stuff. That&#39;s way more pizzazz than I expected. A lot of entertainment and sizzle helped balance out the necessary evils.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would restart a grid if I had to use BSTARS (or any other _STARS entry), but for one like this, that price seemed reasonable. UNNAILED was the only other one that stuck out as contrived, one of the UN- or RE- or -ER type entries I see all the time in ultra-low-word-count puzzles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GREAVE was an oddball. But to get only one of these esoteric trivia answers was great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This type of <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/BWStats/FewestWords\">ultra-low-word-count</a> is not my favorite themeless genre. But I think this one is close to best in class, and that warrants recognition.</p>"]}]}}
