Fun to see those O-shaped bubbles!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolt_Cola\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/37/Joltcola1.png\" style=\"border:none; float:right; height:223px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:200px\" title=\"What a logo!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The annoying engineer in me wondered why oxygen bubbled up, though. It&#39;s carbon dioxide! CO2! NOT O2! IT&#39;S WRONG! WRONG WRONG WRONG! IF IT&#39;S JUST O-SHAPED BUBBLES, WHY IS EACH THEMER IMPLYING OXYGEN BY PROVIDING EXACTLY TWO OS?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Man, that engineer is annoying. Just enjoy the O-shaped bubbles, will you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I liked that Bruce found so many themers, without repeating a key word like SODA or COLA. Tough task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solid grid, lots to love in MALL RATS, SLY WINKS, RAW DATA, CAT TREAT, AD BIZ. Bruce is getting so good at injecting long bubbly fill into his grids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(EEE WIDTH ... not so much. We&#39;ll look the other way for that one.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah, there&#39;s some AMAT ANOS EINE in the short fill, but I&#39;m okay with these as prices to pay for all the great long bonuses. And considering Bruce had to build around five themers, I think he did well!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The one real flaw: the BDAY / BENNET crossing. I expect a good deal out of educated solvers, but knowing all 100 senators seems unrealistic. With DDAY, VDAY, and BDAY all fine answers for an [Annual celebration, for short], a more specific clue was badly needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe that&#39;s just sour grapes, as I guessed VENNET. It seemed plausible at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fun a-ha moment when I realized what was going on with the O-shaped bubbles &mdash; after beating down the annoying engineer complaining about accuracy, that is.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>I got the basic kernel of this theme idea from my buddy <a class=\"hasphoto\" href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?author=Erik+Agard\">Erik Agard</a>, but unfortunately, I was unable to talk Erik into co-construction. He and I did collaborate on another interesting puzzle currently in the NYT queue, and I can tell you he comes up with an amazing number of ingenious ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I knew from the getgo I wanted four theme drinks with at least two O&#39;s (bubbles) each. I remember worrying that COKE ZERO was changing its name to Coke Zero Sugar soon, and worrying that JOLT COLA was popular too long ago (It was re-introduced late in 2017, but still is not real well known). I was determined to come up with a revealer that had no O&#39;s, and then I had to avoid O&#39;s in the rest of the puzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s always harder for me to work with vertical themers, and I knew this would be a Thursday, so I wanted a word count less than 78.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love this weird but intriguing theme concept, and I hope solvers find it challenging but fair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My submitted clue for FILL (at 53-Across) was not &quot;Crossword constructor&#39;s pride&quot; or some such thing, but still, I found it hilarious when the first draft of clues from the editors changed it to &quot;Contents of a trash heap.&quot; I was a little disappointed that the final draft upgraded my FILL to &quot;Dirt in a dump truck, perhaps&quot; &mdash; too funny!</p>"]}]}}
