I usually find these themes dry, as uncovering dictionary-like entries can be more work than pleasure. AGE FOR DRINKING LEGALLY isn&#39;t going to win any crossword awards, for example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_(Adele_album)\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1b/Adele_-_21.png\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:218px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:219px\" title=\"Adele's hit album 21\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Andrew found a nice range of answers, from drinking age to the Adele album, to the 21 gun salute, to blackjack. And I enjoyed the final twist, the last themer telling us that each of the themers had 21 LETTERS IN THESE ANSWERS &ndash; each of them a grid-spanning length. Fun punchline, very meta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was SURE that SPOTS ON ALL SIDES OF A DIE was incorrect. A standard die has opposite sides that equal to seven, i.e. one + six = seven. So the total has to be even!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, wait.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carry the eight, round down, dot the i&#39;s &hellip; oops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, the sum of one through seven = 21, indeed. I knew that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With just six themers, you&#39;d think that a Sunday 140-word puzzle wouldn&#39;t be difficult. And it&#39;s not too bad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But going down to the nearly unheard of 126 words? That&#39;s crazy! I can understand the allure to work in such great bonuses as ELIE WIESEL, MALEFICENT, ONE TOO MANY &ndash; it&#39;s important to get a ton of bonuses in, since the themers are a bit dry. But it&#39;s virtually impossible to execute on a 126-word grid, without glopping a ton of crossword glue all over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hoo boy, was there a lot. I would have sent this one back to smooth away ABLAST, ALOAD, SSTS, OESTE, etc. I stopped keeping track after I hit ten, and it kept right on going. It would have been better to deploy a lot more black squares to separate the themers, facilitating a higher quality of fill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I did appreciate the innovative thinking, the wide range of subjects covered by the number 21, and the punchline. Rare for a definitional puzzle to make me smile at the end.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>I&#39;m a musician (<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://kidbeyond.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1527351475578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEGP0sTFRuSfdhB0-BBs629qNTkqg\" href=\"http://kidbeyond.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kid Beyond</a>) and meditation teacher; I moonlight in game and puzzle design. This idea came after a long day in the recording studio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I liked the notion of cluing &quot;21&quot; with 21-letter phrases, allowing a meta-reference at the bottom. And I loved creating a grid with horizontal and vertical symmetry &mdash; it feels like Mexican tile art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first draft had a bunch of grand ideas &mdash; like running the puzzle on January 21, with &quot;1/21&quot; cluing DATE YOU ARE SOLVING THIS. Will gently told me all the problems this would cause... so out it went.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another ambitious idea was to cram 21&#39;s throughout <strong>all</strong> the clues. I whipped up about 50 of them: references to Century 21, &quot;21 Jump Street,&quot; the 21 Club, pop stars Twenty One Pilots and 21 Savage, etc. Most of these were too stretchy for Will, but he graciously kept a few.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is my second puzzle for the Times. I remain humbled by how many hours go into making a good idea great &mdash; pushing for ever-better fill, redoing the whole grid over and over, trimming blocks down to the bare minimum...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many thanks to puzzle sensei <a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://twitter.com/thatpuzzleguy&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1527351475578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGn65Md5ytxFkfrJU_asmyU7BJ7Aw\" href=\"https://twitter.com/thatpuzzleguy\" target=\"_blank\">Tyler Hinman</a> for all his tireless feedback, Jeff Chen for <a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://xwordinfo.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1527351475578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHKgYuPiZVMc4gG2H7DrT3S5gNs6A\" href=\"http://xwordinfo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">xwordinfo.com</a> and his wonderful Word List, Antony Lewis for the indispensable <a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.crossword-compiler.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1527351475578000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF1kJMMyyR3kfrEJtp0Q3jHawI_0Q\" href=\"https://www.crossword-compiler.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Crossword Compiler</a>, and of course Will for nurturing my work!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hardcore puzzlers may note that this puzzle has only 126 entries, the lowest Sunday word count ever.
