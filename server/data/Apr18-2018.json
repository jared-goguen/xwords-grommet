atop YOU, three times in the grid. Even though HEX and YOU are both shorties, they&#39;re tough to disguise, so some nice finds. TOOT<strong>H EX</strong>TRACTION made me reflexively wince, but it&#39;s a solid answer. MAT<strong>H EX</strong>AM probably made others wince, but this former mathlete approved. And CORN C<strong>HEX</strong> was a good way to finish it off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Put_a_Spell_on_You\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/I_Put_a_Spell_on_You_by_Screamin%27_Jay_Hawkins_US_vinyl.jpg/440px-I_Put_a_Spell_on_You_by_Screamin%27_Jay_Hawkins_US_vinyl.jpg\" style=\"padding: 6px; background-color: white; border: 1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:219px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"HEX / YOU!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EMPT<strong>Y OU</strong>T did a good job of obfuscating YOU, JO<strong>YOU</strong>SLY as well. They&#39;re both long entries, though, and stacking pairs of long theme answers can be problematic. So many pairs of letters to work through!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See: EOUS in top stack, and AIT in close proximity. ESAS / MLLE in middle. BURL / NONU in bottom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pete and Bruce made the grid 16 rows high to center MATH EXAM / JOYOUSLY, but I&#39;d have been as happy with MATH EXAM in the center of a 15x15, with something like YOUTH below it. Might have smoothed things out a bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically, placing long theme answers in rows 3 / 13 (third to last) is the smart choice, giving yourself the most space possible. Here, I think moving them inwards one row apiece could have helped, giving Pete and Bruce more flexibility in filling around all those letter pairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, EOUS would automatically force me to restart a puzzle. BURL or NONU I might let slide if they were the only offender, but I&#39;d work mightily to make sure there wasn&#39;t some better option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I did appreciate the big corners in the SW / NE. BASE HITS / ASTROPOP / APERTURE, yes! ANIMALIA / TROOPERS / SYNOPSIS, triple yes! That&#39;s the way to use those relatively unconstrained sections of a grid. I don&#39;t like ENRY much, but I felt it was a price worth paying for the wide-open goodness packed with juicy answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think the best stacked-themer puzzles are ones where you need to figure out the theme in order to finish the puzzle. <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=11/13/2014\">Tracy Gray had a memorable such one</a>. Finding the HEX atop YOU instances was more of an afterthought for me.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p><strong>BRUCE:</strong> This was entirely Pete&#39;s spelling brew &mdash; I just got consulted on the fill. I had recently done a <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=2/13/2018\">Valentine&#39;s puzzle</a> that utilized stacked central themers in a 16-high grid, so that seemed like a great way to make this difficult construction symmetric. Even so, this was a tough grid to fill cleanly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PETE:</strong> Yeah, I had the idea for the theme, but I had a heck of a time filling the grid. Those three HEX-on-YOU occurrences really made for some headaches. I finally threw it at Bruce who had the brilliant idea to go with a 16x15 grid. That gave it a little more breathing room (if we can all ignore EOUS &mdash; as in nausEOUS). Plus the supersizing enabled Bruce to place one HEX/YOU pairing smack dab in the center of the grid. I think that&#39;s a nice touch. So, in the end, the grid is 90% Bruce&#39;s handiwork. I think I redid one of the corners &mdash; not that I made the end product any better, but so that I could say I had a hand in filling the grid.</p>"]}]}}
