How cool! And ASTOUNDING made up of the letters within OUTSTANDING? These findings aren&#39;t as cool as direct anagrams &ndash; much more flexibility when you can use more or fewer instances of the letters however you want &ndash; but still, DADBLASTED made up out of the letters within DETESTABLE was pretty awesome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Hale\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Nathan_Hale_1925_Issue-half-cent.jpg/440px-Nathan_Hale_1925_Issue-half-cent.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:214px\" title=\"NATHAN HALE has a little bit of ETHAN ALLEN in him\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not as much a fan of PISTACHIOS / POTATO CHIPS. Okay, they&#39;re both snack foods. But that&#39;s a pretty gigantic category. Certainly not as tight as &quot;Revolutionary war heroes&quot; or direct synonyms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEORGIAN ERA and IRON AGE, too. Perhaps if those two time frames were closer &hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CREAM CHEESE made of the letters in SCHMEAR, now that was a great way to end the puzzle. I have a bagel with CREAM CHEESE most every morning, but I&#39;ve never noticed this finding. Great stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also great was Will&#39;s gridwork. Working in six crossing pairs of long(ish) answers into a Sunday grid should be impossible to do without relying on an excess of crossword glue. Most constructors have to splorch on a (very) noticeable amount of glue in order to just made a standard seven-themer Sunday puzzle work. There were a couple of toughies in ARETES, RECTO, KOMBU, REUNES, but wow. To keep it to just that is amazing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will did such a nice job in setting up his grid skeleton and using black squares to keep the themers separated. I highlighted the themers below, so you can better see how careful his spacing was. Such intricate nesting!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My only knock: an overreliance on +preposition phrases. WERE ON, RODE ON, LURES IN, WADE IN, BENT ON &hellip; talk about ADD ONS! Generally, these are fine entries, but the glut grated on my sensibilities. If only a few of those slots had been used for things like APTEST, COBALT, TOP TEN, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first, I wasn&#39;t as impressed as I wanted to be, given that these were something less than direct anagrams. But I liked how the concept opened up room for direct synonyms and tight pairs like NATHAN HALE and ETHAN ALLEN &ndash; something that direct anagrams won&#39;t usually allow. Along with the strong gridwork, this would have been a POW! pick, if some of the pairs hadn&#39;t felt too loosey-goosey.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>The inspiration for this theme was noticing that CREAM CHEESE and SCHMEAR share the same set of letters, and can both be clued as [Bagel topping]. So I had the idea of a bunch of pairs of entries that share both clues and letter banks, and I brainstormed for a while and came up with around a dozen pairs. (ETHAN ALLEN and NATHAN HALE was a fortuitous find &mdash; they were both mentioned within a few seconds of each other on an episode of <em>Outlander</em>.) The only problem is that I needed many, many more pairs to be able to make a theme that fits symmetrically, and coming up with enough by myself would have taken years, so I enlisted a friend to write some code for me &mdash; shoutout to Samir Khan for making this crossword possible. Samir generated thousands of pairs from my word list, and I combed through them to find ones that might work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will liked my first submission, but there was one pair that didn&#39;t fit with the rest - SILENT K and TELEKINESIS, which I had clued along the lines of [Something a Jedi Knight has]. That clue involved trickery, unlike the rest, so he had me replace it. Easier said than done to find a pair that would fit in that exact spot, but eventually, I found a replacement. Anyway, I&#39;ve gone on for a lot longer than I usually do, but that&#39;s because a ton of time went into this theme!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ll just leave readers with a few pairs which didn&#39;t quite work for the theme, but which I enjoyed coming across anyway:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>COASTAL ELITES / SOCIALIST STATE</li>\r\n\t<li>APPASSIONATA / PIANO SONATA</li>\r\n\t<li>FORNICATING / GRATIFICATION</li>\r\n\t<li>NATALIE PORTMAN / EMPEROR PALPATINE</li>\r\n\t<li>FOOT FETISH / IF THE SHOE FITS</li>\r\n\t<li>IT AIN&#39;T OVER TILL IT&#39;S OVER / IT&#39;S NEVER TOO LATE</li>\r\n\t<li>GASTROINTESTINAL / INTERNAL ORGANS</li>\r\n\t<li>DOPPELGANGER / EDGAR ALLAN POE</li>\r\n</ul>"]}]}}
