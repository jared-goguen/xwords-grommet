to him. Who and what are they?"],"JeffNotes":["<p>What&#39;s that H doing in the middle of my Friday themeless puzzle? Forming the words BEET(H)OVEN and EARP(H)ONES, that&#39;s what! Cool finds, those. EARPHONES aren&#39;t totally related to BEETHOVEN &mdash; PIANO, MUSICIAN, CLASSICAL MUSIC, SONATAS, etc. are much closer &mdash; but the pairing mostly works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Beethoven.jpg/440px-Beethoven.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:208px\" title=\"I want a portrait of me in this style\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What didn&#39;t work for me was running it as a Friday themeless puzzle. It ended up in limbo, caught between three crossworlds:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>THEMELESS</strong>. I love me a great mini-theme, as long as the rest of the themeless puzzle doesn&#39;t get compromised. This mini-theme is prety good (notwithstanding EARPHONES being not <em>that</em> related to BEETHOVEN). The visual of the H working in the answers is cool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I need more snazz out of a themeless than ALL IN ONE PRINTER, DELICATE BALANCE, and &hellip; well, that&#39;s NOT A LOT. Along with odd BORESOME and PIERO, and some LEM RRR TAMA crossword glue, it didn&#39;t meet my (admittedly high) expectations for a themeless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>THEMED</strong>. Not nearly enough themage to be a workable mid-week puzzle. It could have gone more in this direction &mdash; Beethoven wrote a lot, so there&#39;s all sorts of FUR ELISE, MOONLIGHT SONATA, themage possibilities. Even the fact that SCHROEDER of Peanuts was a big fan!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>METAPUZZLE</strong>. The NYT is missing the boat here. This could have been a fun contest, where solvers submit the name of a famous composer and something that&#39;s used to listen to him. Yes! But to do it with a notepad, and have no contest? No prizes? No challenge? No bueno! And if it had been a metapuzzle, David could have gone up to a more reasonable word count of say, 74 or 76, and made the fill more snazzy and smooth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s a neat finding, that BEET + large H + OVEN = BEETHOVEN. I wish it had gone solidly into one of the three above camps, though, as trying to straddle these crossword types didn&#39;t quite work for me. I can see how others would appreciate the crossover efforts, though. Valiant attempt.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>When I first wrote this puzzle, I had BRIGHTMAN (as in Sarah) crossing BEETHOVEN; the idea was to pair a classical composer with a &quot;cross-over&quot; artist. Will, tho, liked EARPHONES, which could also be paired with Beethoven better, so I reworked some of the original grid. I think gimmicks like this in a Friday or Saturday are fun and add something to an otherwise-themeless puzzle.</p>"]}]}}
