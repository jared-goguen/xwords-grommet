capability is very useful when trying to construct puzzles like this. <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?regex=(\\w)\\1\\1\">Here are the words in our database with triple letters</a>. Many are bogus (thematic) but there are several good entries in the results list. (The number of entries you see depends on your account level.)"],"JeffNotes":["<p>I&#39;ve seen plenty of triple-letter themers before, most notably employed by <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=10/31/2000\">a Superman theme</a>. I liked John&#39;s take, using TRIDENTS &ndash; think of it as TRI D E N T S &ndash; as a rationale for featuring triple Ds, triple Es, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Flag_of_Barbados.svg/440px-Flag_of_Barbados.svg.png\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:146px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"A TRIDENT on the flag of Barbadddos. Er, Barbados.\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also liked John&#39;s unusual grid layout. It&#39;s rare to start with a long themer at 1-Across because look what it forces: a big chunk of white space up in the NW&#39;s business. That&#39;s a themeless-esque swath, rarely easy to fill, especially when already constrained by a long theme answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was all set to give the thumbs-up, what with delightful PARANOIA / ALAN ALDA, and only UNA and COL as prices to pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But ... SAAR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s one of those words I&#39;d think triply about before including in an early-week puzzle. The crossings are fair, but it&#39;s one of those entries that might cause newer solvers a lot of pause. You don&#39;t want to give newbies any reason to do something else. Let&#39;s get &lsquo;em hooked, people!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually, I don&#39;t care for long fill in the across direction, as it tends to muddy up theme vs. fill. But today&#39;s theme was easy enough to pick out that I didn&#39;t wonder how WAR HORSE was tied in. I did have a slight pause to count how many Ts were in the middle of LATTE ART, but that was okay too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I personally much prefer long fill in the down direction, as it&#39;s more easily identified as puzzle snazzification unrelated to theme. I mean, PALME D&#39;OR is great! And BOHEMIA! And &hellip; KID FLASH? I can name all four people who have been the Flash in the DC universe, but KID FLASH is only vaguely familiar. Still, I enjoyed looking him up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were too many SAAR, ALAI, ERN, SYST odd ducks for an early-week puzzle, but the theme was interesting enough, and the long fill did mostly sizzle. Reasonable balance.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>The theme for this puzzle is not obvious as one is solving (especially given that my original submission had circles around the tripled letters) so I wonder if this will feel like a 74-word themeless puzzle with some after-the-solve head-scratching about the theme. I look forward to hearing how solvers experience it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many fun things about getting a puzzle published in the Times, but perhaps my favorite aspect is the long-distance cluing tutorial I get from seeing the final product. Comparing the clues I submitted to what Will, Joel and Sam ultimately come up with is a great lesson in cluing. The subtle and major changes they make always improve things and point to how I could have clued entries more appropriately or pithily (Me: NOOGIE = Headlock accompanier, often, Them: NOOGIE = Unpleasant accompanier of a headlock). I often give a mental fist pump when a fun or novel clue I spent lots of time coming up with makes it through intact &mdash; for this puzzle my fist pump went to LEIA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, thanks to KID FLASH for being a thing. Not much else fits the K??F?A?? pattern, so this grid doesn&#39;t happen without him.</p>"]}]}}
