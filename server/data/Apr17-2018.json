and consonant. Entries that exhibit this property are very useful for constructors, as they tend to make construction much easier. Fun inside nod to the gridmaking biz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popemobile\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Popemobil_Mai_2007.jpg/460px-Popemobil_Mai_2007.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:145px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"That's one sweet ride!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not so fun: OREL / PALOMA, ODER / ELEV, CAPON, DEREG, ONED, all in a single puzzle. All in an early-week puzzle, to boot. I think everything is ultimately fair, but I worry that a puzzle this gluey is going to turn off less experienced solvers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s an interesting feat of construction that made me think about how it could be done. Pretty easy, as it turns out, writing some code that outputs only the vowel-consonant-alternating entries from one&#39;s list and then filling from there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Too much of a one-trick pony for this solver&#39;s taste, the conceit not worth the price of the hiccups in execution. But a couple of fun entries that fit the pattern, POPEMOBILE the standout, and also Socrates&#39; UNEXAMINED life. And that VOWEL revealer, exhibiting the same property, is definitely memorable.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>When I originally submitted this puzzle, I sent in two versions: one with the reveal in the SE and one with the reveal at 1-Across. I could see the fun in both having the vowel hint to help fill out the grid (as would be the case if it was the first clue) and as having it as a more traditional reveal. Will liked the traditional way which suited me just fine. Another interesting twist was how to treat &quot;Y&quot;: when is it a vowel and when is it not? I ended up removing all Ys in the rewrite to avoid the confusion (though was really sorry to lose the crossing of &quot;ODE TO JOY&quot; and &quot;YO MAMA JOKE&quot;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is my second Times puzzle, and while the excitement of the accomplishment is less the second go &#39;round, it is only ever so slightly less. I&#39;ve got a frame picked out and a place on my wall already chosen. Here&#39;s to running out of wall space before either my brain gives out, or our robot overlords make crossword constructors expendable.</p>"]}]}}
