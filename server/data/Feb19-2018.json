don&#39;t get it. I mean, I get it &ndash; toss in a random letter along with a word and anagram to form a valid phrase &ndash; but why? It feels related to &quot;randomgramming,&quot; a term constructors use, meaning &quot;jumble up the letters because REASONS, that&#39;s why.&quot; So, same qualms as last time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/WI_Police_Dog.jpg/440px-WI_Police_Dog.jpg\" style=\"border:none; float:left; height:204px; margin:6px 12px 6px 0px; width:220px\" title=\"Can I see your badge, sir?\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How awesome would it have been for the extra letters to spell out US OF A! I think this might be a real possibility. But looking through combinations of 44 different presidents x 26 extra letters is not something I&#39;m willing to do just to answer that question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyhoo, one aspect of Bruce&#39;s gridwork I&#39;m digging these days is his usage of seven-letter slots. Often, these get filled with neutral stuff, placeholders that solvers skim over as they go. But ME FIRST / EVIL EYE, LA SCALA / DREAM ON, HAN SOLO &mdash; that&#39;s a ton of great mid-length bonus material!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It does come at a small price, with a bit of AYS, BALDS (odd verb usage) to make those corners work. Totally worth the cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wish there had at least been more time between Bruce&#39;s states + letter randomgramming puzzle and this one. The first time at least felt unique. To get another instance so quickly, with no real change in ideology, wasn&#39;t great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, what is great is the phrase POLICE DOG. Love it. And I&#39;ll go ahead and choose to believe that GARFIELD (plus you, or U) were both LIFEGUARDs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or something like that.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>I did an <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=5/16/2017\">anagrams +1 puzzle on 5/16/17 with state names</a>, so I decided to try one with president&#39;s names. There are some sites online that do this kind of thing, but most of them only give you single word anagrams &mdash; it took me quite a bit of digging to find multiple word phrase options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My submitted puzzle had IMPEL at 55-Down and LSTS at 72-Across. I think that latter entry did not sit well with the editors because they were willing to put I.M. PEI in there even on a Monday to get rid of it. I still think every entry in the puzzle is reasonable for a Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember getting all done and realizing I had FORD in the grid &mdash; ouch &mdash; I found out that even when you know he needs to go, it&#39;s sometimes not that easy to remove a president!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last time one of the reviewers (Jeff Chen) dinged me for not finding added letters that spelled something interesting. This time I went all out and came up with add-on letters (U,A,V,P,P) that anagram to &quot;V.A. pup&quot;, which is of course closely related to a POLICE DOG. For some reason, Will left that piece of info out of the cluing...</p>"]}]}}
