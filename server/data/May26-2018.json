title=\"Everything is awesome, indeed!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>CROWD PLEASER indeed! Such a solid example of a stair stack themeless, Peter hitting on all marks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A great stair stack starts with that oh-so-important middle triplet. CROWD PLEASER / PLAY THE PONIES / THE LEGO MOVIE provide so much zazz. Yes!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then the NW / SE stacks &ndash; POP A PILL / AMAZONIA, and WHATS APP over SNAP CHAT = good usage of those slots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And finally, where many stair stacks fall is in the SW / NE corners, so hard to execute on once the stair stack is fixed in place. THE CURE / PHONE SEX plus STARBASE / BEDTIMES = excellent work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And of course, Peter is such a great gridder that he wove everything together with little to no crossword glue. Some will argue that ENO gets way too much expose for his level of fame, but I think he&#39;s crossworthy enough. And RNS might be hard to figure out if you don&#39;t know it (registered nurses).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I did wonder if POP A PILL was as on point as &quot;pill popper.&quot; But ultimately I thought it was a solid 1-Across.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also don&#39;t love THE CURE crossing THE LEGO MOVIE, at THE, but it&#39;s not a deal-breaker. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Terrific puzzle from one of the top themeless constructors around. It&#39;s not easy to work with 68-word grids, and Peter does it so elegantly.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>More Saturday puzzle good times! This grid layout is something of an old standby for me, with the three long central answers balancing the mid-range entries in each quadrant. A few bullet points about this one:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-I believe DOTEDU was a first in my debut all those years ago, and it looks like this might be the first DOTGOV to grace a mainstream crossword. Be on the lookout for DOTLIMO and DOTDIAMONDS in future puzzles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Yes, I wasn&#39;t all that happy with the THE trio in this grid. In my own halfhearted defense, all three of those entries are pretty solid &amp; if you&#39;re going to repeat a word, the most common in the English language isn&#39;t a bad choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Two companies of eleven-figure Facebook acquisition offers in one quadrant! Stacks like these are the funnest to create.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hope this one is a 34-Across! (sorry...)</p>"]}]}}
