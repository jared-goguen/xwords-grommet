I still greatly enjoy standard themeless layouts, as long as the fill is sparkly, but there&#39;s something so thrilling about seeing something new. Big swaths of white, swirling from SW to NE! More swirliness in the other corners! All done with pretty good grid flow, and a ton of long entries? Color me intrigued. Nervous, too &ndash; it&#39;s so difficult to fill a grid like this well &ndash; but intrigued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Eden\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Barbara_eden_as_jeannie_1966.JPG/300px-Barbara_eden_as_jeannie_1966.JPG\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:249px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:190px\" title=\"Genie! Er, Jeannie.\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such a pleasure to get a snazzy triplet in the middle, FIXED ASSETS / HIGH AND AWAY / BARBARA EDEN. Okay, at least one of these could bore most anyone &ndash; finance haters, baseball haters, old sitcom haters. But I like the variety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Personally, I like finance and baseball (at least the fun slang), but I did do some head-scratching at BARBARA EDEN. When I looked her up on Wikipedia &hellip; man oh man, that theme song! Though I never watched the show, I love <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwpH_IYg0N8\">that jingle</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, GEAR TRAINS and ICE CAPADES worked through the middle stack! As a gearhead, I love GEAR TRAINS. And [Arrangements of teeth?] obfuscating it made it even better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And there was more &mdash; nice stacks in each of the four corners! Loved loved loved PIERCED EAR / ONE MAN ARMY / ISLAND HOPS. Such juicy answers!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, let&#39;s reduce that to two loves. Agreed with Ryan, BEERYS is one of the worst pluralized names I&#39;ve seen in memory. Ick! I&#39;d have preferred the black square at the S as Ryan described, but who knows what it would have done in the NW.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I personally would have never let BEERYS through. But if it enables such a great triplet of long entries, why wouldn&#39;t you? Woudja look at that, after all these years, I&#39;m still adapting my thinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Okay, I still probably would have fought like heck to get rid of BEERYS.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, great usage of his long slots, and I love the innovation and solid execution using a challenging grid pattern. Very impressive work from a relatively new constructor.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>By pure coincidence, this puzzle happens to run on my fianc&eacute;&#39;s birthday, so I&#39;ll take that as an opportunity to talk about him a bit. Quinton and I met as students at Princeton, both singing in the Princeton Nassoons (a cappella group) and the Chamber Choir. After graduation he spent a year in Tajikistan on a fellowship before joining me in the DC area, where we now both work on federal contracts. Although I usually enjoy doing the New York Times themeless puzzles solo, I love him enough to save some Fridays and Saturdays to solve together every few weeks. He especially helps with foreign language, geography, and vocabulary clues. We&#39;ll see if he can finish this one solo!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This puzzle is a bit un-millennial of me in that much of the grid is skewed toward older references, which may trip up some younger solvers. I&#39;ve always been a fan of wide open grids with heavy intersection, even at the sacrifice to some overall zippiness and trendiness in the grid entries. It often makes it more of a challenge to both construct and solve, which I appreciate. This puzzle is an example of this constructing style: it doesn&#39;t quite have the youthful verve throughout, but I think the overall fill quality and intersection in the middle makes up for it. The side sections were a bit more flexible &ndash; only the unfortunate plural BEERYS which I didn&#39;t like, but liked better than the inelegance of adding a black square in the corner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hope you like this (unexpected) birthday present Quinton!</p>"]}]}}
