finance types constantly made fun of the marketing wannabes. Those who can&#39;t do math make up ridiculous slogans! These days, I appreciate marketing much more, so the idea of state capitals coming up with punny ad slogans made me laugh. I loved Michigan trying to attract writers by offering FREE LANSING (freelancing) opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lansing,_Michigan\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7f/LesCapitolSomethingMI.jpg/440px-LesCapitolSomethingMI.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:146px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"FREE LANSING! From what, I'm not sure.\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not as sure about blowing into Maine on AUGUSTA WIND (a gust of wind). Is Maine windy? Seemed odd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the come-on to Alaska, that it&#39;s MORE THAN JUNEAU (more than you know). Wouldn&#39;t a more effective slogan involve bears? Glaciers?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is probably why I didn&#39;t (couldn&#39;t) go into marketing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, CONCORD MY FEARS took me forever to figure out. CONCORD = conquered? Really?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is probably why I&#39;ve had so few pun themes accepted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The allure of a low-word-count grid beckons to many constructors; a siren song. It usually shouldn&#39;t be heeded, because it almost always requires trade-offs that make the solving experience less pleasurable. This is especially important in an early-week puzzle, aimed at less experienced solvers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is kind of cool to have SNO CONE and TUTORED next to each other, both fine mid-length entries. But the cost of NEGRI (&quot;you have to know these kinds of esoteric things to do crosswords?&quot; &ndash; and crossing a tough European capital)? Granted, I think all world capitals are fair game for educated solvers. RIGA isn&#39;t OSLO or LONDON, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out MALAYSIA, too. Love it as fill usually, but it sure makes that NE region big and tough to fill. ELYSE is another esoteric name (see: ELAM), and ENTO ain&#39;t great. Unfortunately, there&#39;s no quick fix, so the grid would have had to be redone with a completely different block pattern (aiming at 76 or 78 words). That&#39;s probably what should have happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I like the notion of a bunch of slick marketers brainstorming ad campaigns. I had some problems with the overall execution, though.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>HEAD DOVER HEELS? BOISE GONNA BE MAD? ANNAPOLIS TASTY? HELENA HANDBASKET? A LINCOLN THE CHAIN? RALEIGH FINGERS? RICHMOND POORMAN?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All rejected ideas for my &quot;capital punishment&quot; puzzle. Yes, that would have been the title. Maybe it&#39;s best there are no titles in a weekday puzzle as there are enough groaners here already. I do like HELENA HANDBASKET, but it has too many letters, sadly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only my second time in the New York Times, and I am already resorting to puns. Sad but true. As for state capitals, Mrs. Wickersham, my fifth-grade teacher, would be pleased. I can still remember studying with Emily Williams who, every time the word &quot;Harrisburg&quot; was uttered would cry out &quot;Harrisburg to you too!&quot; It made no sense at all, but somehow I still remember the capital of Pennsylvania that way. Nonsensical word associations of that ilk, when puns were unavailable, got me through all the memorization I had to do to survive medical school. Thank you, Emily, and Harrisburg to you too!</p>"]}]}}
