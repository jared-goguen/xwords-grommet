of (adjective + article of clothing = slang term for a person). I&#39;ve seen related themes, using STUFFED SHIRT and SMARTY PANTS. But most of them have been much looser, including stuff like MOVIE SHORTS, YELLOW JACKET, BLACK HAT, etc. So I like the added level of tightness today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BLUESTOCKING was a new term to me. Fascinating to read up on the history of the Blue Stockings Society, a women&#39;s pro-education movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had a hard time figuring out if CITY SLICKER was out of place, as the only one where the article of clothing changed meaning. But SMARTY PANTS &hellip; appears not to be related to the PANTS one wears? Not sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As usual, Lynn gives us <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Montagu\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Lady_Elizabeth_Montagu%2C_Duchess_of_Buccleuch_and_Queensberry_%281718-1800%29.jpg/440px-Lady_Elizabeth_Montagu%2C_Duchess_of_Buccleuch_and_Queensberry_%281718-1800%29.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:left; height:250px; margin:6px 12px 6px 0px; width:201px\" title=\"One of the leaders of the BLUE STOCKINGs Society\" /></a>a solid Monday grid. A couple of nice bonuses in PORKY PIG, CAPUCHINS, CHRONICLE. Nothing amazing, but all in all, enough bonuses to keep up my interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most important for a Monday is that it&#39;s accessible to a newer solver, and this one *mostly* fits the bill. Short fill is usually where constructors fall off the wagon, but with just a bit of NEER &ndash; minor, since NEER-do-well is a common enough phrase &ndash; it&#39;s super smooth. Yay!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(There&#39;s an argument to be made that ROCS / AUK might be tricky, but I think these words ought to at least look familiar to educated solvers.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it hadn&#39;t been for BLUESTOCKING &hellip; the last thing you want to do as a constructor is to turn off newer solvers, and I wonder if newbs might scratch their heads even after a correct solve, wondering if they need to know stuff like this to be successful at crosswords.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wondered if BLACK HAT would have been a better inclusion, but stupid crossword symmetry wouldn&#39;t have allowed for that. I couldn&#39;t think of any others to match either BLACK HAT or STUFFED SHIRT. Drat! I suppose I hesitatingly would have ended up making the same decision Lynn did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Someone make up another term already to appease the crossword gods! How about ... MUSTACHIOED SHORTS (describing a lover of enigmatology, of course)?</p>"]}]}}
