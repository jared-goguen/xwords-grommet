Man, do I know a ton of people with this issue &hellip; and COVER BAND, with its fantastically innocent clue: [Act without originality]. That puzzled me for the longest time, but what an a-ha moment when I realized that &quot;act&quot; was a noun, not a verb, in the clue. Two beautiful seed entries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talia_al_Ghul\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d6/Talia_al_Ghul_%28The_Dark_Knight_Rises%29.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:left; height:250px; margin:6px 12px 6px 0px; width:167px\" title=\"SPOILER ALERT! Is that Miranda Tate ... or TALIA al Ghul?\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Themelesses typically feature 12+ longish answers, and constructors try to spread them out as much as possible, for maximum flexibility. Usually, that means putting three in each corner, so that those four stacks don&#39;t interact with each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, Caleb goes big, interlocking six long answers in each of the NW and SE corners. It&#39;s so difficult to get six out of six great long answers in a corner like this, without resorting to crossword glue. The NW was pretty darn good &mdash; WIKI LEAKS and RARE COINS to go with WORD VOMIT? Yes please! With just ON A DOWNER feeling like a long partial, and some minor IT IS and SRS = very good results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wasn&#39;t as hot on the SE. POSSESSES feels a bit cheap, what with all those Ss and Es. EVER SINCE takes up room more than shines. ABERRANCE is an interesting word, but it didn&#39;t hit me as strongly as COVER BANDS. Still, some nice craftsmanship in that corner to put it together without any crossword glue (EELER generally feels fine to me).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But wait, there&#39;s more! Love that Caleb worked in a couple more long entries, MAKESAUTURN looking awesomely French (makes au turn?), and SISTER WIVES jutting into the middle. I wasn&#39;t familiar with the latter term, but it makes sense. If a bit icky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s too bad that the SW and NE corners felt dull, with so many short words concentrated into those spaces. But a themeless puzzle has to have some shorties, and when you place so many long entries in the other corners, the shorties have to go somewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, a great number of juicy entries. I sometimes feel like a moron doing Caleb&#39;s puzzles &mdash; I&#39;m not hip enough to fully appreciate them &mdash; so I was relieved to only get that feeling from AKON, LORDE, and TALIA al Ghul today. And this Batman fan really ought to have known that last one.</p>"]}]}}
