Even more impressive, given that he&#39;s been generally working with lowish word counts. This 68-worder ought to have more than just EMS and GRES holding it together, but somehow, Peter weaved everything together such that you can&#39;t see any of the seams. Impressive craftsmanship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_America_(And_So_Can_You!)\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c5/I_Am_America_%28And_So_Can_You%21%29.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:201px\" title=\"Over 10 years old ... now I feel old\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I like when a puzzle has at least one feature entry that has a shot at being memorable. For me, something like <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=1/9/2009&amp;g=14&amp;d=A\">SAY THE MAGIC WORD</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=9/24/2011&amp;g=24&amp;d=D\">BABY GOT BACK</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=2/10/2018&amp;g=39&amp;d=A\">ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE</a> makes a puzzle stand out in my head. This grid didn&#39;t have one of those for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I can see the argument for the other side, that the latter two entries aren&#39;t as broadly appealing as the first, that themeless entries ought to stick with timeless entries that most everyone can figure out, like QUIET TIME or SHOPAHOLIC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Different strokes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I did enjoy most of the long entries, MBA DEGREE crossing NBA GAMES particularly pleasing. But there were others that felt a bit dated like I AM AMERICA (over 10 years old now, whoa!), and ERICA JONG, whose &quot;Fear of Flying&quot; was published almost 50 years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, Peter and Will did elevate a lot of the entries via great clues. A FOAL gets up and running in a couple of hours = brilliant! Innocently repurposing &quot;up and running&quot; in a literal way is genius.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn&#39;t understand the MBA DEGREE clue at first &ndash; why would you need an MBA to get boarded? Ah! It&#39;s not a doctor&#39;s boards. It&#39;s a Board of Directors. This one wasn&#39;t as strong for me, given that there are many board members who aren&#39;t MBAs, so it felt like the clue needed a giveaway question mark. But it was a good attempt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wonder how many people will write to Will, pointing out his &quot;error,&quot; that DOCTORS DON&#39;T NEED AN MBA!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(If you write to me with that, I&#39;ll politely put it in my spam folder.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A beautifully smooth piece of work, if not so snazzy as to stick in my head.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>This puzzle&#39;s creation began with an old-school approach of mine... Namely, cramming a bunch of Scrabbly letters into the opening corner and building out the grid from there. I&#39;ve grown less infatuated with the rarer letters over the years, shifting my focus more towards smoother fill. That said, it&#39;s still fun to scatter a few J&#39;s and Z&#39;s when the opportunity presents itself. Regardless, hope the end result is an enjoyable solve!</p>"]}]}}
