day! JANET MOCK was unfamiliar to me, but Erik did such a nice job making all the crossings friendly and easy, such that I could learn about MOCK and still conquer my crossword. Some solvers might grouse that ENID is an esoteric name, but realistically, what else could that square be? I bet if 100 people were asked to fill in the blank for a woman&#39;s name, JA_ET, 100 would put in an N.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Mock\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Janet_Mock_Head_Shot.png/440px-Janet_Mock_Head_Shot.png\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:left; height:146px; margin:6px 12px 6px 0px; width:220px\" title=\"JANET MOCK\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I feel privileged to be friends with a good number of constructors. You&#39;d be surprised at how often knowing the author comes in handy during my solves! Erik is one of my favorite folks in the crossworld, and I remember from a while back that he&#39;s into AFROPUNK. Saved my bacon when it came to that NW corner. I was so badly stuck, not able to see the odd CHIPPY and not knowing Edwin STARR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My daughter (age 3) is fascinated with her mom&#39;s MAKEUP. Am I going to have to figure out what a MAKEUP TUTORIAL is?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Sigh, yes.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guess it&#39;s a good thing I learned that term today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of other toughies in PNIN and NADJA. I don&#39;t mind learning a thing or two from a crossword, as long as that doesn&#39;t hinder me in achieving my complete and correct solve. And some solvers seem to dislike having too many proper names in a puzzle, but that doesn&#39;t bother me, as long as they&#39;re well-known. It&#39;s when a constructor delves too far into PNIN / NADJA territory that starts to make me feel like the puzzle is more a trivia contest than a crossword. Just on the verge today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loved GOLD MINER and its brilliant clue, repurposing the term &quot;flash in the pan.&quot; A perfect example of GOLD medal wordplay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZAMBONIS also had a great clue, although if you didn&#39;t know that the &quot;crease&quot; is a term in ice hockey, the cleverness would be lost on you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, no DARK DAY whatsoever, Erik constructing a fine, fair puzzle. It&#39;s tough to get a feeling of excitement when encountering so many foreign-seeming entries, though.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>My thanks to whoever wrote the clues at 16-Across and 57-Across, two of my favorites in the puzzle.</p>"]}]}}
