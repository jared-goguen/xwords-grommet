Reversals. Many puzzles over the years have featured backwards entries. BACK, UP, REVERSE, FLIP are usually hints or revealers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.) Different definitions of a key word. Take a word that has many disparate meanings, find phrases that define said meanings. (Many moons ago, I wanted to use LOG as my key word, and Jill suggested something scatological as we were brainstorming. I knew then she was a keeper.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mash these two up, and you get a three COURSE meal &ndash; reversed! AUGUSTA NATIONAL is a golf COURSE, PREALGEBRA is a school COURSE, and APPETIZERS are a meal COURSE. I like the innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Great bonuses in the fill has become C.C.&#39;s trademark. No surprise to get awesome AU NATUREL, PICANTE, DON&#39;T PANIC, GONDOLA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes I&#39;ve critiqued C.C.&#39;s work with an eye on her craftsmanship, her slight overreliance on crossword glue. I think she&#39;s come a long way, and today I didn&#39;t notice much at all. A bit of ELEC URI, that&#39;s it? Excellent work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I score each new entry as they get introduced into our <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/WordList/\">Xword Info word list</a>, and I waffled on ADD ME. Is this a thing? Granted, I&#39;m not a huge fan of the Facebook (&quot;the&quot; added for humor, of course, I knew that, I REALLY DID!), but do people say ADD ME? Huh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ANALOG got such a great clue. I can just imagine the kids though, saying &quot;wot the heck are watch hands?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More likely, &quot;wot the hell is a watch?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, I liked the innovation. If &quot;reversing A course&quot; had been a real phrase, I might have given this some POW! love. But as is, the anal grammaratician in me hitched on the awkwardness of REVERSING COURSE as a revealer, without that &quot;A.&quot; I know, I&#39;m so darn annoying!</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>Will and the team helped me with the current theme set. I originally had SOUP OR SALAD (later on CAESAR SALAD/CHICKEN SOUP), they gently let me know that those were dishes rather than courses.</p>"]}]}}
