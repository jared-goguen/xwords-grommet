Watch out, MINI and OPEL, you&#39;re blocking traffic! You too, SMART and HONDA!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wait, what? SMART is a brand of car?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, seriously, what is it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Really? It&#39;s an actual brand?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In all lower-caps, as in &quot;smart&quot;? Huh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve certainly seen &quot;smart cars&quot; around Seattle &hellip; I just thought it was a general term, like &quot;smart phone&quot;? Don&#39;t smart cars do all sorts of fancy stuff for you, like picking up your clothing automatically and buying your groceries from Amazon? No?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WELL, HOW SMART ARE THEY REALLY, THEN?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, so now I know that &quot;smart&quot; is a brand. Still, I&#39;d have much preferred a more well-known brand, like ACURA, DODGE or TESLA. CONCRE<strong>TE SLA</strong>B, perhaps?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With <em>so</em> much theme material, there are bound to be compromises in the fill. It ended up much better than I feared, not much more than some ESS, TRAC, OTOE, spread around. The only real sticking point I had was MOLLS &ndash; hard to believe that&#39;s an actual term. So, pretty darn good execution, given the layout. OH MY LORD I was relieved to get less crossword glue as I expected!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall though, the concept would have felt apter if PARALLEL PARKING had been in the middle of the puzzle, with just two pairs of cars in the NW / SE, looking like they&#39;re actually parallel parking on the edges of the puzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Would have been nice to get a more well-known brand than OPEL, as well.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p><strong>NATAN: </strong>This puzzle was such a treat to make, even by the standards of the already lovely JASA process. The people, for one: we&#39;re joined by new faces, like Andy Kravis up at the lectern, who&#39;s so encyclopedic we barely need to research for clues anymore, and new constructors like Susan, Tom, Joe, and more, who&#39;re injecting even more humor and breadth into these collaborations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For another thing, this was one of those puzzles where students became teachers &mdash; the JASA class came up with the revealer, brainstormed the best theme pairs, drew up the skeleton of the grid, and even bailed us out of a bad fill moment by dropping in OH MY LORD where we&#39;d had OH MY WORD and were coming up empty or trivial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were also able to keep a wide-open construction with some nice long entries. Hope y&#39;all like it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ANDY:</strong> This was my first puzzle with the JASA class, and I&#39;m looking forward to making many more with them.</p>"]}
