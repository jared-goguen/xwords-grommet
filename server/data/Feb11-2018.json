cool finds! ORCHESTRATES sounds like &quot;orca straits&quot; = a neat a-ha moment. I love it when you&#39;re left with a &quot;how in heck did the author find those?&quot; feeling. I missed some of them as I solved, so I highlighted them below. I don&#39;t want anyone to miss WHEATIES as &quot;wee tees&quot;!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheaties\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Wheaties_cheerleaders.jpg/440px-Wheaties_cheerleaders.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:165px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"That ain't wee!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The overall solving experience wasn&#39;t nearly as fun as the themers, though. EDH in the starting corner didn&#39;t bode well. I glunked through about a dozen of these gluey bits, making my solve feel inelegant. A couple of nice bonuses in HOT MIC and ORATORIO didn&#39;t alleviate that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why so much gloop? Take another look at the grid highlights below. While it&#39;s an amazing feat to get so much themage interlocked, there&#39;s isn&#39;t a subspace that doesn&#39;t have two or more themers running through it. No Bueno!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After highlighting the themers, my opinion of the puzzle changed &mdash; I would have expected more crossword glue than Matt needed. It&#39;s an amazing job, given the fact that a standard 140-word Sunday puzzle is hard enough to make &hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&#39;s still too much fluff. And it was so easy to miss those themers, that even I &mdash; an inconceivably anal constructor &mdash; didn&#39;t see or appreciate the interlock until I did my highlighting. Heck, I missed highlighting a themer and then had to go back through a third time! So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good layout for the NYT&#39;s mass audience. Doesn&#39;t do the themers justice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But some great finds that made me want to go back and appreciate each one. I think it could have been a standout puzzle if the themers had been pared back and then presented in such a way to make them easily noticeable &mdash; perhaps all in the across direction, or even shading the theme squares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s tough when your themers are normal words/phrases, and BORDEAUX is the same length as ORATORIO, DINETTES, IS HE DEAD, ALL ROUND. Way too easy to confuse what&#39;s theme and what&#39;s not.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>This was such a fun puzzle to make; I hope it was as much fun to solve! Since everything is a word, Dr.Fill rips through it with no mistakes in a few seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will was very kind to my clues this time, using the vast majority of them and, as always, I found some of his changes interesting. I had gone with the slightly edgier [Bridgegate locale] for 19-D and with [Death of a telethon host?] for 35-A. Not sure what people will think of those. Will also removed my slightly political [Company that recalled 18 million products after outsourcing production to China in 2002] for 40-A. I had clued 9-D as [Start of something big] and was sorry to see that changed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI never know where to clue fill as an abbreviation. So, for example, my clue for 100-D involved a couple of actresses. 110-D was [Am partner], and 106-A was [Baby/pigeon commonality]. I&#39;d love to hear what people think of these changes, and I&#39;ll hopefully learn something!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMostly, though, I had a great time finding the ever-so-painful puns and then subjecting everyone where I work to them. Hopefully, all of you groaned as much as they did. I guess I&#39;d be remiss not to include some of the words that wound up on the cutting room floor.
