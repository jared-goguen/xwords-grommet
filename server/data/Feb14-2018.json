Maybe I just don&#39;t appreciate VDay? Or the themers felt too overt, not playful? Or I couldn&#39;t get past the asymmetry?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupid\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Roman_de_la_Rose_f._13r_%28The_god_of_love_shoots_an_arrow_at_the_lover%29.jpg/440px-Roman_de_la_Rose_f._13r_%28The_god_of_love_shoots_an_arrow_at_the_lover%29.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:left; height:151px; margin:6px 12px 6px 0px; width:220px\" title=\"I find the entire premise of CUPIDS ARROWS kind of creepy ...\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I counterproposed a mini-theme that would run as a (mirror symmetry) themeless the Friday before VDay, with something like BOXING G<strong>LOVE</strong>S / GARLIC C<strong>LOVE</strong>S / T<strong>HE ART</strong>S. But Will felt that was too subtle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What about a heart-shaped grid with LOVE TRUMPS HATE down the middle? Too political. Good point!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, it just wasn&#39;t for me, and I passed. But I can see how VDay fanatics could dig what&#39;s going on, HEARTSTRINGS / CUPIDS ARROWS / SAINT VALENTINE forming a loose VDay theme. I would have preferred something tighter for a themed puzzle though; a stronger connection between the three themers. Not just &quot;stuff related to VDay.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mostly solid gridwork though, snappy entries in GO ON A SPREE, STATE SENATORS, ROTISSERIE, NEVERLAND, even BOATYARD, SO AND SOS and MARION ROSS (hands up for a childhood crush on Mrs. C?).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&#39;t mind a bit of EEO and TAS &mdash; I used to see EEO all the time when I was hiring for our startup way back when, and I had plenty of TAS even further back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TIRO and TWPS are much, much more egregious to me, though. Not just TYRO, but a variant of it? Yikes! And TWPS is &hellip; twerps? TW Power Services of Australia? It&#39;s &quot;townships&quot;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And DINGE. Dingy, sure. But DINGE sticks out like some dinge on the puzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think the compromises to get the themeless-like feel to the puzzle were okay overall, but oof, did those three bits jar me out of my solve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I still have a lot of trouble getting past the lack of symmetry inside the puzzle. The annoyingly OCD constructor inside me wants some reason for it, like <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=7/10/2009\">Joe Krozel&#39;s clever BROKEN HEART</a> concept. But I can appreciate the novelty of the puzzle, as well as the heartfelt sentiment from ML.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>This puzzle was originally submitted in December 2016 as a 17x diagramless submission. Will surprised me writing:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Oddly enough, I think this would work better for the regular paper than as a diagramless. As a diagramless the grid is too chunky &mdash; too difficult, I think. As a 69-word regular crossword, this could work as a daily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, to run as a daily, the puzzle would have to meet themeless standards, and this grid has a lot of unappealing vocabulary. ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This doesn&#39;t look like an easy grid to fill. But if somehow you can improve the vocabulary, I&#39;d be happy to take another look.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After many go-rounds on a very slow, old laptop I managed to come up with a more cleanly filled grid that Will was pleased with except for the upper right corner. A big thank you to Frank Longo who smoothed out the top of the grid and to Will for his patience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope you enjoyed the puzzle. From my heart to yours.</p>"]}]}}
