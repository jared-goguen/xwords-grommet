I appreciate that constant drive to cut out stale theme concepts. I even more appreciate the willingness to accept a few here and there, when they stand out as something a little different. I had to spend some time forming my opinion on this one, but ultimately, I thought it was really good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0f/Threebody.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:left; height:250px; margin:6px 12px 6px 0px; width:173px\" title=\"Great book! Full of crazy and awesome ideas.\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&#39;s going on with weird entries like MEGATS at 26-Across? It&#39;s actually MEGAT(SUN)AMI, with the entry turning at SUN, thus FOLLOWING THE SUN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I scratched my head at why the answer wouldn&#39;t just keep on going down, though &ndash; why turn back to its original direction after running through SUN?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A-ha! Maybe it&#39;s like plants that follow the sun when the SUN goes behind a cloud (we have a few of those here in Seattle). Therefore, the answer SHOULD keep going in its original direction after running through the available SUN?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that makes sense. No?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And why do the themers on the right-hand side go up? That felt bizarre to me &hellip; until I realized that Finn was representing the SUN rising in the east (right side of puzzle) and setting in the west (left side)! Clever, made perfect sense and gave me a neat a-ha moment indeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why three suns on each side? It must have been &hellip; the &quot;three-body problem&quot;? (A famous, intractable math/physics problem speaking to the effects of initial conditions.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sure, why not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slight theme reservations aside, such a pleasurable grid to run through. SO much great bonus fill, I almost appreciated it more as a themeless than a themed puzzle. All the ones Finn mentioned, plus more? (Some may not know the SUNK COST dilemma in economics, but it&#39;s fascinating.) Yes, yes, yes!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though I had initial reservations about the concept, I enjoyed that &quot;rising in the east, setting in the west&quot; a-ha moment so much. Along with such a delightful grid replete with fantastic fill, this puzzle ended up being a SUNny delight.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>The seed for this puzzle (and its original title) was &quot;Sunrise, Sunset&quot;&mdash;with the eastern theme entires featuring a rising S-U-N, and the western ones featuring a setting S-U-N. It was important to me that none of these entires&mdash;whether the across ones or the down answers containing SUN&mdash;use that letter string to mean the word &quot;sun.&quot; This was a bit harder than expected! You may notice that I broke a fairly rigid crossword rule in that the theme entries are not symmetrically placed, but it would have been near impossible to do so, given that they each span several rows. I did try to put them in approximately symmetrical locations, for consistency&#39;s sake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the themers take up a lot of real estate in both across and down directions, filling this grid was a beast. This is the third draft I submitted, and while I wish there were a bit more room for the grid to breathe, I think it&#39;s free of dreck (REE being the only real gross entry, IMO). Phrases like SUNK COST, PROM DATES, REAL TALK, NERF WAR, and MIC DROP are fun bonus fill. I tried for way too long to get YASQUEEN at 11D (it really almost worked for a long time) but finally let it go when it came at the expense of too much bad fill).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m quite happy that my original clue on I SEE IT made it through; it feels much more in-the-language than previous methods of cluing that entry (variations of [Response to &quot;Look over there!&quot;]). In general, I like to make my puzzles contemporary and conversational, which I think I&#39;ve accomplished here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, I&#39;m honored to have a puzzle run on the Sunday of ACPT for the second time! It&#39;s a pretty cool thing to see 600+ of the most avid crossword solvers in the world digging into your puzzle. See you in Stamford!</p>"]}
