I&#39;ll admit I didn&#39;t see the SEETHING / SEE THINGS &quot;dupe&quot; David mentioned, but I enjoyed the Easter egg. I thought the puzzle was fun and well-crafted already, and that bonus elevated this one to my POW! pick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_parking_rack\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Witte_fietsen_de_hoge_veluwe.jpg/440px-Witte_fietsen_de_hoge_veluwe.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:187px\" title=\"A bike rack is are called a BIKE STAND. Huh!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s so tough to create a themeless around ultra-long seed entries, and when you interlock four of them together, it&#39;s even tougher. The problem is that these long entries usually take up so much real estate that there&#39;s not much room left for other good entries. The puzzle then lives or dies on the quality of just those long entries. That&#39;s a lot of pressure on those few entries!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoyed the long ones a lot today, and the puzzle could have *almost* stood on those alone. I CAN TAKE A HINT is fantastic, one worth seeding a themeless with. ETHICAL DILEMMAS is great too, and LOSE SLEEP OVER ain&#39;t too shabby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CABLE TELEVISION isn&#39;t as good, as most people say &quot;cable TV.&quot; But it does work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most constructors would put a black square at the T of TREPAN or the H of HECATE &ndash; as David mentioned, these types of huge corners with two triple-stacks intersecting each other are usually to be avoided at all costs. Way too hard to execute on with both snazziness and smoothness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoyed that NW corner a lot. ENTRANCE is more a workmanlike entry, but I appreciated how changing the stressed syllable morphs the meaning of the word completely. And riffing off the SEE THINGS / SEETHING &quot;dupe,&quot; I liked the quasi-echo of ENTRECHAT and ENTRANCE. They look so similar but etymologically aren&#39;t. Cool!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And some great clues. My favorite: [One getting hit after hit?] made me laugh, as there&#39;s quite a bit of pot usage in Seattle these days. STONERs!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s a bit too much short glue, NNW, ESTO, HAR, INE, etc. for my taste, but most themelesses featuring interlocked long seed entries have way more than this &ndash; as do themelesses with corners like the NW / SE! So very well done overall.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>As you probably guessed, this puzzle started with SEETHING and SEE THINGS. Really looking forward to seeing how everyone reacts to such a long &quot;dupe&quot;&mdash;at 1-Across/1-Down, no less! Working with stacked 8s crossing stacked 9s was brutal, though, especially since two of the long entries were already locked in. Not thrilled with the resulting crosswordese, though I do really like BEER MONEY, EYE CANDY, LOSE SLEEP OVER, ETHICAL DILEMMAS, and especially I CAN TAKE A HINT. All in all, I appreciate that Will let me bring some variety to the Friday themeless slot, and I&#39;m pleased with how this puzzle turned out given the constraints. Hope you enjoy!</p>"]}
