href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Quantum\">Schrödinger</a> (jokes can be delivered WRYLY or DRYLY, dogs have PAWS or PADS at the ends of their legs, and WINING and DINING are forms of entertainment). It&#39;s a neat mesh of two tried-and-true theme types, producing something different. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_square\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Sator_Square_at_Opp%C3%A8de.jpg/440px-Sator_Square_at_Opp%C3%A8de.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:218px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"One of the earliest WORD SQUAREs\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best Schrodingers are those where both options seem equally valid &mdash; solvers would put either in, 50/50. That&#39;s exactly the case for WRYLY / DRYLY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAWS and PADS not as much &ndash; I immediately put in PAWS. I had to think a bit after finishing before PADS made sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And WINING / DINING &hellip; that one felt slightly different to me, as it&#39;s rare to use DINING to describe &quot;entertaining&quot; without combining it with WINING. So WINING (which is much more used by itself), felt strongly like the only &quot;correct&quot; answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve heard of WORD SQUAREs before, but wasn&#39;t exactly sure what they were. Came back to me quickly after reading the Wikipedia article, though, and it made for a perfect descriptor of the concept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ah, PES. The anatomic foot. Next to QAT, one of those words Scrabble players must learn in order to play competitively. Why the two ooky glooky offenders? As much as I love TRIASSIC and GRIDIRON, two delightful grid bonuses, they were the cause. If you use black squares to break up TRIASSIC at the first S and GRIDIRON at the D, it makes the north and south sections so much easier to fill well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRIASSIC / GRIDIRON worth the price of PES / QAT? Not to me, especially since Tim already fulfilled my quota of great fill with TORCH RELAY and CUP OF COCOA. PES in particular is one of those Maleskan words that give crosswords a bad name. YOU HAVE TO KNOW RIDICULOUS STUFF TO DO CROSSWORDS! I&#39;d mark it as a puzzle-killer, if I had my druthers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(I can just see Scrabble-lovers up in arms saying QAT IS AN IMPORTANT WORD!!!)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall though, I liked the innovation, mixifying two standard theme types to produce something new. That&#39;s the kind of thing I love in a NYT Thursday puzzle.</p>"]}
