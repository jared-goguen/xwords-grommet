No!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four FORs today!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(I&#39;m definitely not four for four.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Victor and Andy pair up theme answers, RECIPE FOR DISASTER transforming [Recipe that entails a lot of shaking] into [DISASTER that entails a lot of shaking] = EARTHQUAKE. I like that the clue reads naturally both ways, making it seem so innocent as presented. Good stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only one that made me hitch was PLAY FOR TIME modifying [Play of Shakespeare] into [TIME of Shakespeare] = ELIZABETHAN ERA. &quot;Shakespearean play,&quot; yes. &quot;Play written by Shakespeare,&quot; yes. &quot;Play of Shakespeare&quot; &hellip; not really. Even without the telltale &quot;remember X-Across&quot; hints, I would have known that something was up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are so many X FOR Y phrases out there that this theme initially felt too loosey-goosey for my taste. Yes, crossword symmetry limits the pairings, since it&#39;s tough to get everything to match up in length. But it felt too easy to come up with examples, given the dozens of X FOR Y options to work with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After some thought though, I appreciated that they chose long X and Y words, much harder to work with than &quot;in for it&quot; or &quot;free for all&quot; or things that are less specific. Length matters! Ahem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Andy noted, the element today that stood out for me was the bonus fill &mdash; so much of the long bonuses sizzled, elevating my solving experience. It&#39;s not easy to incorporate eight themers into a Sunday 140-worder, and they did extremely well in grid execution. A ton of fantastic bonuses, while keeping their crossword glue to only a small smattering of minor ERE ESS etc. Very few constructors can execute on a Sunday 140-word grid with such craftsmanship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fantastic clues for TESLAS and CHEESE! [They&#39;re charged for rides] = people who take cabs and Ubers, right? And [It&#39;s said to cause a smile] had to be some happy thought? (It is weird that the word CHEESE forces you to smile. Bizarre.) Beautiful misdirections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Would have been great to have a sharper a-ha moment &mdash; the &quot;remember&quot; hints gave away the game much too easily &mdash; but I liked the concept.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>We enjoyed creating the puzzle and coming up with possible pairs (WATER FOR ELEPHANTS / LARGE-EARED = &quot;Like the water in Africa&quot; and PAN FOR GOLD / LEPRECHAUN = &quot;He keeps his pan in a pot&quot; didn&#39;t quite make the cut). We were really happy with how the fill came out, and we hope that people were satisfied with the difficulty level and the amount of connection provided between the substitutes and the substituted clues.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>VICTOR:</strong> I think that I am at my best as a constructor when I am coming up with new ways to play with how a puzzle works. I tend to write Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday puzzles as a result, and I think that this was among my better efforts. I also seem to like ideas that are difficult to turn into a viable puzzle, which makes working with Andy, who is an amazing grid constructor/filler, really nice. I like collaborating in general because everyone has different skills, and something good almost always emerges. Now, if I could just learn to nae nae &hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ANDY:</strong> Victor always has clever and ambitious theme ideas. It&#39;s a fun challenge to try to make clean, interesting grids out of them without compromising on theme content. This one needed a lot of tweaking, but eventually, everything just fell into place. I&#39;m really happy with all the fresh non-theme fill we were able to include (ACE OF HEARTS, WALK ON WATER, CARE BEARS, GAYBORHOODS, BOYS&#39; LIFE, PIANO TRIO, TOTE BOARD, SEAN YOUNG, PET GOAT, etc.) with very little crosswordese or junk fill.</p>"]}
