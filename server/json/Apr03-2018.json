Er, THINK QUICKLY &mdash; Damon ends seven phrases with letter homophones spelling out Q U I C K L Y. I&#39;ve seen many letter homophone puzzles before, but I can&#39;t remember this exact take. Enjoyable concept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosera\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Drosera_capensis_bend.JPG/440px-Drosera_capensis_bend.JPG\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:184px\" title=\"The SUNDEW, up close. Pretty!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I put Damon in rarefied air these days, one of the few constructors with the skills to construct solid puzzles across the full range, from easy early-weekers to tough themelesses. Many people can develop the skills necessary to construct one type of puzzle but aren&#39;t able to successfully stretch themselves like Damon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, this Tuesday puzzle wasn&#39;t as smooth as I&#39;d like. Any time you have to call upon ABOU early in the week is not so good. I don&#39;t mind some ALS / SYS or ERN, but toss in some toughies like YOST and LASSE, and the puzzle left me with an overall sense of esoterica.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, it&#39;s super tough to work with eight (!) themers in a 15x15 puzzle. Even tougher when you have to work with the X and Q in NETFLIX QUEUE. And it&#39;s no surprise some of the quirkier answers like YOST crop up in between themers (MARY KAY / BUT WHY). Overall, I think it&#39;s a reasonable result given the very high theme density.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wanted to give this one the POW! I enjoyed piecing together the letters, a delightful idea. If only THINK QUICKLY had been as snazzy a phrase as THINK FAST, or QUICK THINKING, I probably would have swept the grid glue under the rug and declared this the POW!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, with just Q U I C K in QUICK THINKING, the grid would probably have been a lot smoother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, a strong idea executed almost to POW! territory. But not quite.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>Letters-as-words puzzles have been done before, so I wanted to distinguish this one in two ways: 1) Spell a longish word with fun, Scrabbly letters; 2) make the revealer clue a dual-meaning instruction to the solver. I came up with THINK QUICKLY rather quickly, but it took me a while to flesh out the details. Since there are so many theme answers (8), most of them had to be short, and I was stuck on &lsquo;L&#39; for a long time. Once I thought of KAL-EL everything was super, man.
