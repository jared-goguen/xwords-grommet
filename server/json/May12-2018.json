constructors would have the guts to tackle something like the middle of this grid. (I&#39;ve tried and gone down in flames.) Jaw-droppingly huge! My mouth hung open even further when I uncovered the super-snazzy CEMENT SHOES and FALSE BOTTOM. Whoa! Huge swaths never contain stuff this good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Stockage_de_ciments.JPG/440px-Stockage_de_ciments.JPG\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:164px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"That'll make some big shoes!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>HORSE HOCKEY wasn&#39;t immediately familiar to me, but I vaguely remember Col. Sherman Potter saying it? Maybe I&#39;ll try it out in real life and see what people say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&#39;t mind a little SOO glue to hold a giant section together. But FENSTER and BELEM are bizarre entries I&#39;m more used to seeing in a region like this (and used to being annoyed by). Overall though, I thought they were worth the price of working in such great CEMENT SHOES / FALSE BOTTOM answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times &hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note how smartly Alex segmented his four corners so that they didn&#39;t have much interaction with the middle. It&#39;s clever &ndash; there&#39;s enough interconnect that it didn&#39;t completely mess with my solving flow, but it still gave Alex enough flexibility to fill each corner with further goodness. I think just as long as there are at least two entries connecting one subsection to the rest of the puzzle, the solving flow is passable. Important to not strand the solver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The corners aren&#39;t nearly as big as the middle, but they&#39;re not cakewalks to construct, either. I thought Alex did best in the NE, with LOWLIFES, HOEDOWN, SOFTIE, TWEEZE, and a very minor EER to pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pretty decent results everywhere else, too. OCEANO and OROIDE are heavy costs for ANOMALY and MNEMONIC, but overall, a good set of trade-offs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m not a fan of choking down gloopy entries like BELEM, but I realize that they&#39;re usually necessary for puzzles like this. I like seeing this type once in a while, so I&#39;m okay with it.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>This puzzle was my Mount Everest. That enormous swath of whitespace in the center was the ultimate challenge &mdash; I can&#39;t even count the number of minutes I spent watching my crossword software automatically fill it in, while I ate some pasta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s what I didn&#39;t know about making crossword puzzles: it requires a LOT of effort and battery power for the computer to do all the work. As the ultimate cruel joke, I actually had to reach under my desk at one point and fetch the power cable, to charge my computer and prevent it from succumbing to sheer exhaustion. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somehow, the puzzle came together (I&#39;m not sure when; I left to play GTA for a while), and the end result is this beautiful piece of crosswording for which I obviously deserve the credit.
