Can&#39;t remember seeing anything quite like this, featuring both mirror symmetry as well as three additional 15-letter grid-spanners. Talk about audacious! I love that Erik continually pushes his boundaries. Kicking things off with THAT&#39;S A TALL ORDER is right!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Raisin_in_the_Sun\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c5/RaisinInTheSun.JPG\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:172px\" title=\"Starring Sidney Poitier and Rudy Dee? Wish I could have seen it!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quad-stacks are notorious for 1.) needing a ton of crossword glue to hold them together, 2.) containing grid-spanning entries that are a bit dull, 3.) requiring an excessive amount of common letters (E, R, S, T, etc.).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I thought Erik did pretty well with criterion number 2. THAT&#39;S A TALL ORDER is great. MAKE A FRESH START, too. A RAISIN IN THE SUN has been used in a many a triple- or quad-stack, so it loses some points from me, but there&#39;s no doubt that it&#39;s crossworthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wasn&#39;t familiar with EACH ONE TEACH ONE, but what a neat phrase to learn. Took me a while to grok its meaning, but it&#39;s a great way to emphasize the importance of passing on one&#39;s learnings, making for an exponential passing on of knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Criterion number 1 &hellip; well, quad stacks are tough. There are so many uber-constrained crossings to work through. Can&#39;t say I enjoyed A CAKE, A TIEMPO, LATH, ENURE (inure more commonly, yeah?), TSE, the tough HARAM / MEL crossing, all at the top of the puzzle. About par for the course for a quad-stack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quad-stacks usually have so many compromises that I was super glad to wash away some of them with all the other feature material in SPARED NO EXPENSE, VICTORIA&#39;S SECRET, even INDEPENDENCE AVE. ECLAIRS and EAR PIECES also helped make me feel like I got my money&#39;s worth out of this puzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bottom of the puzzle was much more to my taste than the quad-stack, in terms of trade-offs &mdash; two strong grid-spanners, with just a bit of RET, DECA, ISAO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, I like seeing new patterns, new construction challenges in themelesses. The quad-stack didn&#39;t quite stand out for me given the liabilities needed to hold it together, but I did like the grid-spanning entries more than in usual quad-stacks. And the bottom of the puzzle worked well for me.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>Always wanted to do a quad stack. Probably won&#39;t go for the quint.
