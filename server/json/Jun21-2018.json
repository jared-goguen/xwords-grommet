Er, solve the rainbow using a purple for indigo + violet substitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/images/bonus/SpaceNeedlePride.jpg\" style=\"width:171px; height:250px; border:none;float:right; margin: 6px 0px 6px 12px;\" alt=\"\" title=\"Pride at the Space Needle\" />\r\n\r\n<p>So more like, solve the rainbow, but only in a manner of speaking. Esque. Ish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s no surprise that I stayed out of marketing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(start sheepishness) I didn&#39;t realize this puzzle was supposed to be the rainbow flag &mdash; which has only six colors, not seven! Jim pointed that out to me after I groused about not adhering to ROY G. BIV. I&#39;m especially embarrassed since pride month is huge here in Seattle. There are rainbow flags in every other storefront. (end sheepishness)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoyed the entries that didn&#39;t work without the color. BAY PACKER means nothing by itself, but a lot of cheeseheads are going to enjoy seeing (GREEN) BAY PACKER in the grid today. Same goes for LANTERN &ndash; what a boring name for a superhero. GREEN LANTERN, now that&#39;s much better!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the flip side, the path to an Oscar could be just a CARPET. And PEPPERS are salad items. Not completely necessary to think of these as (RED) CARPET and (YELLOW) PEPPERS, yeah? So they don&#39;t work as well as the other themers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interesting choice to work in ADIOS AMIGOS and OFF ONE&#39;S GAME. Both a super solid pieces of fill. But they do masquerade as themers at first glance since they&#39;re the longest across answers. I might have preferred to break them up since AP SPANISH and PASTORATE are good enough bonuses for one puzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some nice finds, and excellent gridwork &ndash; <em>so</em> many short theme answers to work around. Check out how many down answers run through three themers, which usually is a huge problem. Amazing that the grid is so smooth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colors of the rainbow have been tapped for crosswords a bit too often, so something amazing has to be done to catch my attention. This one wasn&#39;t quite there for me. If PRIDE MONTH or RAINBOW FLAG had been in the grid somewhere (catching this unobservant idiot&#39;s attention), that could have done it. Heck, use one of those as a title, and it would have gotten some POW! consideration.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p><strong>DAVID: </strong>I had so much fun working with Milo! I&#39;ve been a big fan of his puzzles ever since he debuted in <em>The New York Times </em>as another young constructor. Anyway, Milo came up with this idea and many of the theme entries; my suggestion was switching from a 15x15 to a 17x13, which looks more like a flag. We were also able to space out the stripes more evenly that way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fill was a nightmare, given the constraints of all the theme entries. Milo and I went back and forth many times before settling on something close to what you see&mdash;the only difference is that (RED) PANDA is now the more familiar (RED) BARON, which I think was a nice suggestion from Will/Joel. The short fill still has more trade-offs than usual, but we hope the theme makes up for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happy Pride Month!</p>"]}
