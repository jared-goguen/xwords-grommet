Loved it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squat_%28exercise%29\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Squat.png\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:230px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:169px\" title=\"Okay, it'd be pretty impressive if this dude can actually get off the ground...\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I like BOOK PROPOSAL a lot, being a writer and all, and EMPHASIS MINE was strong too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s so tough to feature 12-letter entries in themelesses. Look at how those three black squares at the end of EMPHASIS MINE and the start of BOOK PROPOSAL fix so much into place. Themelesses often benefit from shifting black squares around like crazy, testing, testing, testing. Not easy to do when you already start with some fixed black squares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn&#39;t know what a SQUAT JUMP was, but it seemed self-explanatory (starting from a squat &hellip; and then jumping?). Neat how it interlocked with the 12s above, and also PORTRAIT GALLERY. Strong backbone to the puzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But also a fairly inflexible one. BEQ did well to work in LAZY BONES and TROMBONE (still waiting for someone to use the awesome SAD TROMBONE), but that further rigidified things. Not a surprise to end up needing some LST (yikes), ONEL in the SW, along with the more-neutral-than-positive SCENE II and TO HELEN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, it&#39;s so tough to make 7-letter entries stand out. I did like LE MONDE, and I INSIST was a nice one too. But COLLATE, LEASE TO, ROOT FOR, ESTEEMS &hellip; just taking up valuable real estate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ROOT FOR actually did get elevated by its clue &mdash; I was so confused, wondering what the back rows of a stadium were called. Nope, &quot;back&quot; as in support! That&#39;s the way to make a dull entry stand out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A neat skeleton structuring this 72-word grid. But as a 72-worder &mdash; the max number of allowable words in a themeless &mdash; I wanted a little more juice. Those corners full of 7s are so tough to make sing.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>This is one of my go to grids when making themelesses. Peter Gordon was the first (I believe) to do a pattern like this with the 12s and the stacked 7s. Basically it allows for some solid anchoring phrases and enough room to breathe to have clean fill in the remaining corners.</p>"]}
