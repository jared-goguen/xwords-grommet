Hilarious to think about a bunch of horses getting together for a bit of a hay klatch. The others didn&#39;t elicit as much of a smile from me, but they worked well enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I always wondered what hasty pudding was. The Anglophile in me wants to try it! Wait. It&#39;s &quot;wheat flour cooked in milk or water until it reaches the consistency of a thick batter or an oatmeal porridge&quot;? Oh, you Brits and your disgusting foods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Funny to see SRSLY in the NYT. I cocked my head when I first encountered it a few years ago. Kids these days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mighty fine gridwork, STIR IT UP, DARK GREEN, even SPA DAY lovely additions. I wasn&#39;t sure who THE WEEKND was, but I had at least heard of this name.

I think &quot;doctor&quot; is the &quot;to rig an unfair game&quot; meaning, and &quot;engineer&quot; is more the &quot;jerry-rig&quot; definition? I like the misdirect, but it was a bit too clever for this engineer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, that revealer. Oh, oh, oh.

Isn&#39;t that implying that 18-Across, etc. have circled letters? I think that&#39;s a dangling participle or something. Not that I know what a dangling participle is, but something is dingle-dangling in there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An enjoyable, well-made romp, with such an apt extra layer to tighten the theme. If the clue for SPOONERISMS hadn&#39;t been so long, confusing, and dongle-dungling and some of the themers had been funnier, this would have gotten POW! consideration.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>Thanks to the NYT team, not least for their incredible clue at 62-Down. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, see if you can figure out this theme answer that was left on the something room floor: [Breaking pitch thrown by an oddsmaker?] (6,6)</p>"]}
