I&#39;ve done that a few times in my day, my defender&#39;s face all crinkled up in agony. (Okay fine, on an 8-foot hoop.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taras_Bulba_(1962_film)\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e6/Taras_Bulba_-_1962_-_Poster.png\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:163px\" title=\"TARAS BULBA ... the movie! Looks like there's a lot going on there.\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh &hellip; it means [Display, as an image, using only a small number of different tones] too?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huh. Fully agreed with Damon. I suppose it&#39;s a niche term that will get lost on non-bball fans, but still, I think it&#39;s an awesome piece of slang to learn. Hopefully, it will expand to other spheres of life. That annoying driver, not moving when the light turns green because he&#39;s staring at his cell phone, and the cops nab him for breaking Washington&#39;s distracted driving law?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>POSTERIZEd!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, maybe not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choosing to ignore that cluing decision, I loved how the puzzle kicked off. Combining POSTERIZE with ESCAPE POD and WHATS MORE made for a great triple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TATTOOIST running through it, though &hellip; it&#39;s a &quot;tattoo artist,&quot; isn&#39;t it? I have a tat, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d ever say I went to a TATTOOIST to get it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from TATTOOIST, I liked Damon&#39;s usage of his long slots. EXCUSE YOU is colorful. ARMY BRAT clued as a kid with a &quot;moving&quot; life story, IT&#39;S A WRAP, the awesome brand name CHEEZ WHIZ, ARISTOTLE, etc. = more than enough to keep up my interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&#39;t mind an esoteric name/thing here and there, especially in a Saturday puzzle. Ron SANTO ... I&#39;m expected to know non-Hall-of-Fame baseball players? Thankfully, Damon made all the crossings fair and easy, so SANTO didn&#39;t hinder my correct solve. But staring at SANTO, wondering if that could truly be right, wasn&#39;t a good feeling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ADDED NOTE:</strong> apparently many of my readers are baseball fans! Ron SANTO was elected to the HOF in 2012, so that one is on me. Not the first or last time I&#39;ll be wrong! Thanks all for letting me know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the NE corner &hellip; huh. I learned what an ARHAT was through crosswords, but I do think it&#39;s fair game. Just because it&#39;s from a culture not yours doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s bad!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TARAS Bulba I also learned from crosswords. That consonant-vowel alternation is so useful to constructors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>STETS, too. I&#39;m not sure my editor at HarperCollins would know what STETS means. (His line editor definitely does, though.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of ARHAT / TARAS / STETS is pretty minor to me. All together though, and I might have asked for a redo of that corner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s too bad &ndash; a sore spot on an otherwise pretty darn good puzzle.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>I made this one many years ago. It sat in the queue even longer than usual. It looks pretty good to me now, with one major exception. 1-Across was a seed answer, and the original clue was something like &quot;Humiliate on the hardwood.&quot; As basketball fans know, to POSTERIZE somebody is to dunk on them in such an impressive fashion that the image is worthy of being put on a poster. It&#39;s a fun, lively term evoking basketball awesomeness. Why, why, why then would you change the clue to reference a mundane, technical printing process? Maybe it helps the non-sports fan, but at the expense of watering-down the puzzle for everybody &ndash; it doesn&#39;t seem like a good trade-off to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there is a good chance I&#39;m way off on all of this and solvers won&#39;t care much about it, and instead, the main objection will be something else that never even crossed my mind. That seems to be how it goes.</p>"]}
