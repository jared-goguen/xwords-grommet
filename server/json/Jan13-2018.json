Hit my sweet spot of using black squares to create a visually-pleasing backdrop, while not using TOO many. Did you notice that the grid is also symmetric about the SW to NE axis? Elegant!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_Rae\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/78/Norma_rae_ver2.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:159px\" title=\"Field work = awesome clue!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some great entries, too. Loved PRIDE PARADE / UNITED FRONT and EGG MCMUFFINS / IM IMPRESSED in the longest slots &mdash; now that&#39;s the way to squeeze the most out of those all-important spaces!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not a lot of other long slots, but they were also well-used in WATER DOG / SORE SPOT and NORMA RAE / SEMIARID &hellip; well, three out of four ain&#39;t bad. SEMIARID is pretty dry. (*rimshot*)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love how NORMA RAE was elevated by its clue. It&#39;s not a movie that sticks in my head, but to clue it so innocently with [Field work] (it starred Sally Field) makes it shine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Same goes for USO TOUR. Kind of old-timey feeling as an entry, but again, [Hope was once its driving force] obfuscates innocently away from (Bob) Hope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of seven-letter entries, Alan did a nice job of using his mid-length slots. They&#39;re often tough to convert into snazzy material, but IQ TESTS is lovely, as are ROUGH IT, CUT TIME (classical music is often in 4/4 time, and CUT TIME halves it to 2/2).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EL DUQUE &hellip; I vaguely remember him because of his awesome nickname, but I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s crossworthy? Granted, he won four rings, but will he make it to the Hall of Fame? Not sure if he&#39;s someone all educated solvers ought to know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BIT SEC &hellip; I&#39;m somewhat tech-savvy, but this one&#39;s new for me. Not sure it&#39;s the type of debut entry one should strive for. Mb/sec is more common, yeah?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Charles HAID &hellip; he had his day, back in the day. But not sure he&#39;s earned his crossworthiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beautiful pattern of black squares, some great feature answers, mostly smooth flow to the puzzle. If Alan had been able to avoid the aforementioned clunkers (plus OTT, ALIS, AREOLAR, REARER), it would have been in POW! contention. It&#39;s so tough to make a wide-open 64-worder like this work without those types of compromises, though.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>My first themeless in the New York Times! O happy day! After having numerous ones rejected you&#39;d think I would now have a better idea of what Will Shortz and company are looking for, but sadly I don&#39;t. Looking over the grid, it looks like a normal themeless of mine, but something must have caught their eye. I do remember in Joel&#39;s acceptance letter he said there were a lot of assets in the puzzle with little dreck. One interesting thing is that it doesn&#39;t appear that this grid pattern has ever been used in the New York Times before. Maybe its different look helped get it accepted? Enjoy!</p>"]}
