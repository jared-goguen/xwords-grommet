It's a phrase that often amuses Americans."],"JeffNotes":["<p>Oh no! Or should I say, O no? Seriously, with all the crossword love Yoko gets, no ONO in the grid today?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacup\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Five_Piece_Tea_Service_with_Chrysanthemum_Design_LACMA_M.2006.132.10a-i.jpg/440px-Five_Piece_Tea_Service_with_Chrysanthemum_Design_LACMA_M.2006.132.10a-i.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:135px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"PALACE CUPs, perhaps?\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pretty easy to find words that become other words by removing an O. But it&#39;s hard to come up with themers that amuse. I thought Jeffrey did well in that regard, nearly all of them somewhat chuckle-worthy. CURSE CORRECTION was fantastic as a censor&#39;s job, and who doesn&#39;t like a PROPER NUN?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FUR ON THE FLOOR and CURT REPORTERS weren&#39;t as funny to me, as they weren&#39;t quite as ridiculous as I like in this type of theme. Or perhaps it&#39;s the fact that this cat owner has a ton of fur on his floor ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For such a simple letter removal theme, it would have been nicer to have no other Os in the themers at least. Why take an O out of NOUN, but not PROPER?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>O wait! Oh, you. Took me a while, but I realize after reading Jeffrey&#39;s note that it&#39;s not just a simple O removal, but an OU to U switch. Ah, that makes it <em>much</em> better. There aren&#39;t nearly as many words that can work like this. My bad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solid gridwork. Threading in a GOOD FAIRY, BULLFINCH, GETS READY, HIRES A CAR &hellip; although, I squinted at GOOD FAIRY at first. Are there bad fairies? Apparently yes! And HIRES A CAR sounded off, but I ain&#39;t no Brit, guv. So overall, good bonuses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I appreciated the smooth grid, too, just an EER to hold it all together. Strong craftsmanship, especially considering the five long themers and the extras in the fill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wish I had realized there was more than just an O removal when I was solving. Too bad there wasn&#39;t a revealer to make me realize that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh you, Jeffrey &hellip;</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>This puzzle uses a tried-and-true gimmick: removing one letter of a two-letter set (here, removing the O from OU) to create a new word. When submitting a puzzle like this, the constructor risks rejection by not offering an utterly fresh concept. It then becomes a matter of whether the editor thinks the transformations in the theme entries are clear, clever and, of course, funny. That latter quality is the hardest to attain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this puzzle, the first three theme answers provide, I think, the most humor (FUR ON THE FLOOR is my favorite). They also were able to elicit terse, natural-sounding clues, which makes the overall experience more satisfying. The last two are, in my opinion, perfectly fine but a bit more standard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was interested to see that the editorial process set the cluing at a rather easy level; for the New York Times, it seems like a Monday or Tuesday puzzle to me. Perhaps the gimmick itself was deemed not appropriate for early-week crosswords. Anyhow, I hope solvers enjoy it.</p>"]}
