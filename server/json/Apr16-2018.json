play the &quot;guess the theme&quot; game on Mondays. With just SUNNI ISLAM, I was pretty sure there would be more *I I* phrases. Bingo! SETI INSTITUTE and SKI INSTRUCTOR are both fun entries matching that pattern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/SETI%40home_Multi-Beam_screensaver.png/500px-SETI%40home_Multi-Beam_screensaver.png\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:165px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"SETI has a neat distributed computing model\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ANTI-IMMIGRATION, not so much, considering my parents were immigrants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though I got the theme, I wasn&#39;t able to guess the revealer. EYE CONTACT = perfect! Playful, &quot;eye&quot; sounding like &quot;I,&quot; with two Is contacting each other at the end of one word and the beginning of the next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theme was executed pretty consistently &ndash; for example, there were never two Is within a single word, as in HAWAII. And I couldn&#39;t think of another theme possibility like this, making it a tight set. Great work there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Minor nit, ANTI-IMMIGRATION is the only one with a hyphen, so it&#39;s not perfectly consistent.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoyed it enough that I considered it for the POW! But ETUI nearly kills that by itself, for a Monday puzzle at least. Add in LEM (lunar &hellip; something ... module? excursion?), UTIL, COOER, and it&#39;s too much. I don&#39;t mind COOER as much as LEM &ndash; even though it&#39;s a gluey answer, it&#39;s figure-out-able. Not so much with LEM or ETUI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note how ETUI was pretty much forced by SETI INSTITUTE / ANTI IMMIGRATION. That E??I pattern is generally to be avoided, as there are very few good options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually, I think four themers + revealer is about right these days, but I&#39;d have been happier without ANTI IMMIGRATION. It would have given the grid a ton more room to breathe; more opportunities to both smoothify things and work in more juicy bonus fill like ICY ROADS and NO WISER.</p>"]}
