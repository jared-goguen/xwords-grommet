Q-sound changes / additions have been done several times before in different venues (sorry Dani!), but just as long as the results are amusing, there&#39;s room for another one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRENCH QUOTE (from &quot;trench coat&quot;) as a quote from a guy in a trench? Funny stuff! ORDER IN THE QUART (from &quot;order in the court&quot;) as a request for ice cream delivery? Amusing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_Washington\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Kerry_Washington_Django_avp.jpg/440px-Kerry_Washington_Django_avp.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:166px\" title=\"Dunno — ask her!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was only one that didn&#39;t kite &ndash; er, quite &ndash; do it for me: QUERY WASHINGTON. It works fine from a technical standpoint, deriving from Kerry Washington. But neither the resulting phrase nor its clue carries any humor &mdash; no entertaining images elicited. A shame to kick off the puzzle with your weakest themer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No doubt that humor is subjective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fun to get all the Qs throughout the puzzle. It helped my solve, as once I was onto the theme, I kept asking myself what down answers were likely to contain Qs. [Trophy alternative] had to be PLA<strong>Q</strong>UE. [Hard-shell clams]? I confidently plunked in <strong>Q</strong>UAHOGS without any crossing letters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fun when a theme helps with the rest of the solve! Made me feel kick on the draw.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Er, quick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Good gridwork overall, especially considering how many Qs Dani had to work around. Some of those Qs came at a price, req&#39;ing SEQS and ESQS. But that&#39;s not bad at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hitched at some of the ERY REDYE ETHNO IDEO YEO stuff, but it wasn&#39;t much different from other Sunday 140-word puzzles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ROHAN &hellip; even this LotR fanboy had to squint at that one a few times before moving on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>APACE ANNOYER stretched me a bit further. Darn it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But ultimately, it was a reasonable set of trade-offs given the level of difficulty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only real wince I had was RWR crossing SHAWNEES (and ESURANCE to a lesser degree). I pieced it all together &ndash; SHAWNEES had to be more right than SHAHNEES or SHAYNEES, and I should have recognized SHAWNEES more immediately &mdash; but who is RWR?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ronald &hellip; Reagan? Since when does anyone refer to him as RWR? Or even Ronald W. Reagan? Huh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, great to get all those Qs, in amusingly kooky phrases. Fun finds.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>I&#39;m super excited for everyone to see my first ever Sunday puzzle! It&#39;s been over ten years since I got my first crossword published, but the first time I tried to make a Sunday was last year. I wasn&#39;t sure I wanted to put in all the extra time and effort without even knowing how the puzzle would be received, but I finally figured I might as well try. And this is the result. Lesson learned!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think this theme (changing the &quot;K&quot; sound at the starts of words to the &quot;Q&quot; sound) is great because the idea is very simple and the resulting phrases are... quite quirky! As Will noted regarding a previous puzzle of mine, puns with Qs are a lot of fun. I&#39;m very surprised that this theme hadn&#39;t been done before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m pleased that most of my clues were kept, and as always I appreciate the vast majority of the changes from Will and crew. A few clues I liked that didn&#39;t make it:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>46-Down: Are BEINGS by definition [Sentient ones]? Would that make the expression &quot;sentient beings&quot; redundant? Anyway, I thought my clue was cute: [Livers?].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>91-Down: I guess [Graphic opening?] doesn&#39;t pass the breakfast test, so it was replaced by [Prefix with -graphic]. Oh well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>96-Down: I think my clue was more colorful than [Bagel variety]: [Source of the headline &quot;Area Man&#39;s Life Comes to Tragic Middle,&quot; with &quot;The&quot;].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have a fun solve!</p>"]}
