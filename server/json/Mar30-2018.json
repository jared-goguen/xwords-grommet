themeless exhibits a decent level of gridwork proficiency, I&#39;m pretty happy. What turns a good themeless into a great one for me is the difficult-to-define quality of &quot;voice.&quot; In the writing world, agents and editors are all searching for voice, that spark in a manuscript that makes it un-put-down-able. Sometimes it&#39;s personal resonance, sometimes it&#39;s the author&#39;s ability to generate tension, or a character&#39;s memorable dialogue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constance_Wu\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/ConstanceImage.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:191px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"TIGER MOM from &quot;Fresh Off the Boat.&quot; She's spot on!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A long-winded way of saying that I&#39;m a fan of Sam&#39;s voice. Such a nice pairing of WELCOME TO MY LIFE and DON&#39;T WAIT UP FOR ME, both catchy, common phrases. NEVER FAILS echoes WELCOME TO MY LIFE, as does PLEASE STOP and DON&#39;T WAIT UP FOR ME. I like when a themeless shows these fortuitous connections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the beautiful entry/clue pairings:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>ENEMY SPY is great on its own. But [Plant from another country] so innocently made me think of flora. It&#39;s a beautiful clue that couldn&#39;t have been used for just SPY, elevating an already great entry to standout status.</li>\r\n\t<li>A REAR AXLE generates &quot;backspin&quot; &mdash; as in, the back axle of the car spinning. A bit groany, but also a bit genius.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The puzzle also spoke to me through TIGER MOM, a term both hilarious and tear-inducing for me and my peers. I&#39;m still waiting for someone to debut ASIAN F (an A minus, according to TIGER MOMs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seriously, my mom once looked at my report card that had all As and one A minus, and said &quot;why didn&#39;t you do better?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were a couple of dabs of crossword glue here and there &mdash; PKS (penalty kicks), the AMU Darya River, RIMA &mdash; but not enough to make me give Sam the side-eye. A ton of beautiful long entries that personally resonated with me (part of me is a surf bum at heart, wanting eventually to run a SURF SHOP). Close to getting the POW! but it got edged out by another puzzle to come this week.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>Is the term TIGER MOM common? It&#39;s super familiar to me, but I have led a ... let&#39;s say &quot;biased&quot; life, filled with math nerds and their helicopter parents. I hope that the metaphor is at least evocative even for those to whom the term is unfamiliar!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if you enjoyed this puzzle (or the ones from the past week by Finn, Andy, and Claire!), consider donating and buying <a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://queerqrosswords.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1522124612009000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGAl61DbXzR_MTJ06yCJZPth-2TPw\" href=\"http://queerqrosswords.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Queer Qrosswords</a>!</p>"]}
