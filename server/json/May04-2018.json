He said the secret is to stick with 72 words, making every one of your long entries count. And of course, minimizing your crossword glue. Easy peasy!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krypton\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/William_Ramsay_working.jpg/440px-William_Ramsay_working.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:163px\" title=\"Wait, that's not Superman ...\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nice example in the NW, a great triplet of HACKTIVISM / IMPRESARIO / STAYCATION. Editors tend to value multi-word entries since they&#39;re often more colorful than one-worders. Plus, parsing them makes for a fun solving challenge. But these one-worders are nice. A bit of AMT, TECS holding it together, but both of those are minor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mike usually sticks to straightforward themeless grids, focusing all his juice in the four corners, with each corner having three stacked long entries. So it was nice to see him branch out with MONEY TALKS running through the NW stack, and KRYPTON / OPEN WIDE making the puzzle feel like it had good stuff woven all through it. I like it when something fun pops up everywhere you turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m realizing more and more that there are different tiers of themeless feature entries, and my method for evaluation is shifting. To me, the best entries those that are both 1.) snazzy in their own right, and 2.) ripe for a clever clue. ONE STOP SHOP hits both of those right on. &quot;Has a lot in store for you&quot; made me laugh. Very well done, Mike!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HACKTIVISM is a fantastic headliner. But since not everyone will know what it means, it must have a definitional clue. So it doesn&#39;t hit criterion #2 for me. It&#39;s still a colorful phrase, just not an entry that ticks all the boxes anymore for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>KRYPTON might be a dull entry for some, but its clue made it shine. DC area wasn&#39;t the District of Columbia, but DC Comics &ndash; as in Superman&#39;s homeworld! So although the entry might fall short of criterion #1 for some, it hits #2 with high marks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of strong entries, not much crossword glue. If it had had a little more pizzazz overall, it would have been my POW!</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>Today&#39;s puzzle is my first solo themeless puzzle after collaborating with John Guzzetta on my first three. Because we received some editorial pushback on previous portmanteaus, I worried a bit about stacking HACKTIVISM and STAYCATION in such close proximity. Will liked both, so perhaps these entries are regarded as more common. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of my favorite clues survived the edit, including &quot;DC area?&quot; for KRYPTON and &quot;What has a lot in store for you?&quot; for ONESTOPSHOP. &quot;Long Division?&quot; for AFCWEST did not make the cut however, likely because Howie has been too long out of the game.</p>"]}
