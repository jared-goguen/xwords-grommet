Catchy theme phrases, fun concept, strong bonuses in the longer fill, little to no gluey bits in the short fill. Platonic!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_boxing\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Ouch-boxing-footwork.jpg/340px-Ouch-boxing-footwork.jpg\" style=\"border:none; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:166px\" title=\"AMATEUR BOXERS ... you think they're wearing boxers?\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, I don&#39;t exactly know what &quot;Platonic ideal&quot; means. Something about the perfect thing ... right? I tried to read the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_idealism\">Wikipedia entry</a>, but it wasn&#39;t ideal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Middle-grade-level humor hits my sweet spot, so I enjoyed the plays upon BRIEFS, JOCKEYS, BOXERS, SHORTS, DRAWERS. Something about AMATEUR BOXERS really tickled me &mdash; keep on practicing, underwear, and one day you&#39;ll make the big time!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It helps that I&#39;m a fan of these &quot;kooky interpretation&quot; types of puzzles. I enjoy snappy phrases in crossword grids, and I also like funny interpretations of said phrases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amateur underwear, tee hee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love how Bruce wove in a bit of extra mid-length stuff, ROAD WIN, and EKG TEST, to further spice things up past ORGANISM and REFEREES. Constructors usually break up these areas for ease of filling &ndash; you could place a black square at the D of ROAD WIN, for example. I did hitch slightly on EKG TEST, as it&#39;s usually called just an EKG, but ROAD WIN was well worth it for me. And no prices to pay, in terms of short fill around these regions!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>INANER was the lone squinty entry for me. I did squint pretty hard at it. But it&#39;s not the inaner-est thing in the world. Overlookable, given all the goodness in the puzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wonderful puzzle, especially considering the difficulty of constructing around five themers, one of which is an awkward 13 letters. Not many (any?) Mondays are truly memorable to me, but that&#39;s not their purpose &ndash; they ought to first and foremost, be accessible and interesting to newbs. I&#39;d happily hand this to a rookie solver.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>I remember driving down the freeway a year ago and hearing someone on the radio use JOCKEYS as a synonym for underwear. I think some basketball player got faked out of his or her jockeys. This was news to me, and it got me thinking that there are quite a few underwear synonyms with wordplay potential. I remember my dad being excited right away that I had an underwear puzzle accepted by the New York Times &mdash; mom, on the other hand, had a few questions ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=1/3/2018\">food pun puzzle of 1/3/18</a> had the phrase RIDE UP, which has multiple possible meanings but ended up being clued as &quot;What underwear may do, annoyingly&quot; &mdash; I&#39;m thinking skivvy humor may be under-appreciated, and I hope solvers have some fun with this.</p>"]}
