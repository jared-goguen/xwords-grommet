Bonus points for ending an entry with a J. That ...FOJ string looks so neatly bizarre! AU LAIT was an interesting one too, tougher to uncover than the others. I was expecting an O&#39; somewhere (Cafe O&#39;Lait = Irish coffee?).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_au_lait\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Caf%C3%A9_au_lait.jpg/500px-Caf%C3%A9_au_lait.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:left; height:165px; margin:6px 12px 6px 0px; width:220px\" title=\"CAFE OLAY ... er, AU LAIT\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rhyming words have been mined for many crosswords, so it&#39;s important to go above and beyond with some extra layer. Here, I like Sam&#39;s tightness, nearly covering the solution space of O-?AY rhymers. The only other ones I could think of were OIL OF OLAY (oil of au lait?) and ANITA O&#39;DAY. Something elegant about using a complete(ish) set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAF&Eacute; AU LAIT is a great entry in its own right. MILO O&#39;SHEA is definitely crossworthy, although he might be on the cusp of what an educated solver (especially a newer one) ought to know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GLASS OF OJ &hellip; I hesitated at first, as the phrase didn&#39;t feel solid enough for my taste. But it&#39;s something I&#39;ve said at diners, so I&#39;m not sure why it didn&#39;t strike me as strongly as CAF&Eacute; AU LAIT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had the same reaction to IS THAT OKAY. It doesn&#39;t feel like something I&#39;d strive to work into a crossword. YOU WILL OBEY left me with the same feeling. Maybe I haven&#39;t been to enough hypnosis acts?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Audacious layout. I said DEAR GOD to myself when I turned up ETES and ESS within seconds of starting the grid &mdash; neither is friendly to beginning solvers. Thankfully, OTHELLO and TEA CADDY felt worthy of those prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>KLATCH might be a toughie for newer solvers, as might be MALA fide. And the crossing of URBANA / AVEDA could be a trap that takes away a solver&#39;s feeling of accomplishment &hellip; if they guessed URBINA or URBENA I would be sympathetic. All in all, I would have preferred a grid layout that didn&#39;t push the Monday boundaries so much. Breaking up the four corners more would have been my preference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall though, I appreciated that Sam gave us something a little more than a standard rhyming theme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ADDED NOTE:</strong> Glad I read Sam&#39;s commentary! I didn&#39;t realize the short-short-short-long patterm of syllables! That&#39;s a neat extra layer. Wish there had been some revealer in the grid to point it out.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>Yep, that&#39;s my byline above a Monday puzzle. *Rubs eyes* Is this real life?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The theme I came up with was friendly enough for beginner solvers?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s nothing too crazy in the fill?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The clues are ... easy?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started where most constructors don&#39;t, and shouldn&#39;t: telling myself that I really needed to make a Monday puzzle with no ideas for it whatsoever. I decided to poke around XWord Info for past themes I enjoyed, and came across <a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date%3D3/16/2009&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515278213240000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9zg7qsDY0bJsushD1fIMgvVyBqg\" href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=3/16/2009\">this Lynn Lempel gem</a>, which contained eight phrases that all rhymed despite having different spellings. I thought the idea was so clever and wondered if I could vary it somehow but still introduce a novel concept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I figured the long &quot;A&quot; sound was worth pursuing and noticed that MILO O&#39;SHEA and ANCHORS AWEIGH stacked nicely together in a grid. From there, I refined the long &quot;A&quot; answers to have the &quot;short-short-short long&quot; cadence of the two above: CHINESE BUFFET, SO NOT OKAY, etc. But I still wasn&#39;t satisfied yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s when CAFE AU LAIT emerged from the cobwebs to make a grand entrance: AU LAIT double-rhymed with both OKAY and O&#39;SHEA, their associated phrases followed the same rhythm, and they were all spelled differently. What an &quot;aha&quot; moment that was! With OBEY and OJ proving viable as well, I realized that this was the grid I had to make.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as fill goes, I obsessively focused on keeping proper nouns to a minimum, unless they were truly zippy and worth knowing (TY COBB, ST. CLAIR). After watching my friends develop from novices into regular solvers, I now know that normally fine answers such as LETO and TULL may be tough early in the week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hope you enjoyed! <a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.crosswordtournament.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515278213241000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEdYLVsWycjNXmOLZ4KvNNegqUBgw\" href=\"http://www.crosswordtournament.com/\">Have you signed up for the ACPT yet?</a></p>"]}
