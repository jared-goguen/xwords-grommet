If I can guess it within one or two themers, I usually feel like it&#39;s too simple. After uncovering just AF/RAME, I rolled my eyes and said SPLIT LEVEL HOUSE. What a great surprise to have the much more fun HOUSEBROKEN!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramen\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Fresh_ramen_noodle_001.jpg/440px-Fresh_ramen_noodle_001.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:160px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"Yum, RAMEN NOODLEs!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nice to get a humbling Jeff-is-wrong moment once in a while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(There are a lot of them.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something so pretty about those circled letters. Often, circles in puzzles tend to distract me, but I liked these.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not a lot of sizzling themers, but RAMEN NOODLE and LEXICON were both strong. (READ UP and OLAF aren&#39;t going to win any awards. EPOCHAL &hellip; huh. It&#39;s dictionary supported.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Emily had only broken CHALET into CHA/LET, making way for something more interesting, like CAPTCHA &hellip; or I GOTCHA!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of I GOTCHA, I thought Emily shined in her gridwork. URBAN SPRAWL and PENNANT RACE were both fantastic, as were I GOTCHA and SHERMAN, especially working in his &quot;WAR is hell&quot; quote. I even dug THRACE, a throwback to my favorite world history classes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then there was the short fill. Great attention to detail! Emily did have a great deal of flexibility, the ___RAN, CH___ patterns having a ton of possibilities, for example. But with so many of them to fill around, many constructors would have ended up with a lot more crossword glue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, loved that WELSH clue. What a crazy awesome WELSH name, Llwynywermod.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, an excellent Tuesday puzzle, one I&#39;d be happy to recommend to newer solvers. Nothing flashy, but very solid.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>The idea for this puzzle stemmed from the first one I ever constructed which had &quot;break a leg&quot; as the revealer with different leg bones broken across my theme answers. At the time I thought it was sensational, but it was rejected, and I can see why. As with many of my early attempts, it was, to put it nicely, hot garbage. Looking back at it now is like the crossword equivalent of finding an old middle school yearbook photo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later, when the very talented <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?author=Samuel+A.+Donaldson\" class=\"hasphoto\">Sam Donaldson</a> made a much more successful <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=7/12/2016\">broken bone themed puzzle</a> (published on my birthday of all days) I took it as a sign that I should revisit the &quot;broken&quot; theme concept. I was hitting a brick wall until I tried breaking the houses over different answers as opposed to trying to find individual theme answers that would work. This also allowed for less constrained fill and some more interesting long non-themed answers. So overall I&#39;m pretty happy with the result, but my eye always goes to LYCRAS which I hate and realize is a stupid plural, but marginally less not-a-real-thing than LUCRES which was my other alternative in that spot.</p>"]}
