groundbreaking 2008 puzzle</a> by Frank Longo."],"JeffNotes":["<p>Tremendous visual impact &mdash; such humongous swaths of white space! A real eye-catcher. It even looks a little like an eye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platy_(fish)\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/28/Female_mickey_mouse_platys.jpg/440px-Female_mickey_mouse_platys.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:left; height:164px; margin:6px 12px 6px 0px; width:220px\" title=\"These apparently are PLATIES\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Triple stacks on the top and bottom, grid-spanners in the center ... are you singing along to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DohRa9lsx0Q\">&quot;Stuck in the Middle with You,&quot;</a> too?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I did get stuck in the middle, unfortunately, which was frustrating since the grid is so sectioned off: top, middle, bottom. And to hit PLATIES ... wha &hellip;? I&#39;m super glad I&#39;ve seen RIO RITA in crosswords before. Otherwise, that T would have been a total guess. Same goes for ELAND, although I do think that most animals are fair game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As one would expect, lots of compromises to hold the triple-stacks together. I thought Roland did better in the bottom than the top. A LOOP, REROOT, at least those are gettable. Not great to have the RE- addition reoccur in REOCCUR, but that does feel like a more common RE- usage than REROOT. AWACS and ACTA ain&#39;t great either, OYE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And TASSETS. Again ... wha?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe those are related to PLATIES?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But BIOLUMINESCENCE / INTEREST RATE CUT / TESTED THE WATERS were so snazzy and solid that I surprisingly didn&#39;t mind the splotches of glue everywhere. That&#39;s a great triple payoff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also surprising that the top, with the lesser evils of ETE TAE ICI CITS bothered me more. Why? LAST THE DISTANCE didn&#39;t last the distance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GO THE DISTANCE! Go go go! LAST? No no no! If I&#39;m going to be made to slog through crossword glue, it has to be worthwhile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a feeling I&#39;ll hear gripes from solvers today, but I think there&#39;s a place for these wildly-eye catching grids every once in a while. This one had its strong points.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>This puzzle was constructed in September 2017 and accepted for publication in January 2018. It&#39;s had an unusual history. The original version was constructed in September 2016, but was rejected because there were too many problems with the triple stacks. That effort, however, established the central fill. Over the next year or so several versions were produced using that same central fill, but they all fell short in the triple stacks or their crossings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last September I decided to give it one last attempt. I did some work supplementing the 15-letter answers in my word list. I also decided to change the last two letters of CEREMONIAL STAFF to RT, because it offered more possibilities for the bottom stack. I took more time to produce this version, and it is the best one of the bunch. I was elated when it was accepted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A fair number of my clues survived the final edit. Two of my favorites are SUPER GLUE (34A &ndash; Stuff used in some nasty pranks) and REROOTS (37D &ndash; Gets accustomed to a transplant).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to Will and his team for their patience with me on this one, and for their work on the clues.</p>"]}
