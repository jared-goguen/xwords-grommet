Because the theme answers start with synonyms for GO. As in DEPART, EXIT &hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Er, more like synonyms for &quot;GO!&quot; SCAT! SCRAM already! Kind of a pushy Monday puzzle, sheesh! Trying to tell us something, hmm, Lynn?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some neat finds, most of the themers snazzy. I wasn&#39;t sure what a SCATTER RUG was (another term for a throw rug apparently), but I like the sound of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hitched slightly on LEAVENED BREAD, as it&#39;s the only one where the GO! synonym changes pronunciation. It would have been nice for all of them to have a pronunciation change, or none of them, for consistency&#39;s sake. Ah well. The crossword gods can be cruel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are GITANO JEANS still a thing?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, this is the way to execute on a simple Monday theme. Go up to 78 words if you need to, but make sure to weave in at least a couple of long bonuses &mdash; WEARS THIN, INSIDIOUS, MCQUEEN, even ATTACHE &mdash; while keeping your short stuff from getting noticed. Lynn is so good about using those longer slots to her advantage, elevating the solving experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although, there was one area I felt was subpar for her: the DDE / ALEE / DUNNE region. It would have been fine if it had been any other constructor, but a little-used Presidential monogram, a nautical term, and an actress from &quot;old Hollywood&quot;? Not quite up to Lynn&#39;s bar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I liked MCQUEEN and the YOUNG / THING pairing. I&#39;d personally have chosen to smoothify the grid by taking one or more of those out. But I can respect Lynn&#39;s choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, a fine Monday puzzle. I liked the theme enough that I considered it for the POW! If the revealer had packed more punch, creating a sharper a-ha moment, it might well have been my pick.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>This was an exceedingly rare, once-in-a-blue-moon puzzle for me: Once the phrase &quot;go first&quot; popped into my head, the theme idea and all four theme entries were a done deal within, say,15 minutes. And within an hour, the grid was finished. That just never happens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I submitted the puzzle close to a year ago, without the circles. I thought the revealer would make everything obvious enough without them, and that people would have a nicer aha moment by seeing it on their own. But yeah, it&#39;s Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only a pair of clue changes to note&mdash;the Michael Jackson ones at 11- and 12-Down. I could never have written them, never having heard of the song. But then, you all probably knew that!</p>"]}
