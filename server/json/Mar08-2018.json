when I have to think about a theme! &quot;Line dancers&quot; become LYIN&#39; DANCERS through the insertion of an &quot;in&quot; sound. Or a long I? Something in between? Hard to explain, but whatever it is, it&#39;s consistent. Line -&gt; LYIN&#39;, moon -&gt; MOOIN&#39;, plain -&gt; PLAYIN&#39;, bean -&gt; BEIN&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupcake\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Chocolate_cupcakes_with_cream_icing_and_red_sprinkles.jpg/440px-Chocolate_cupcakes_with_cream_icing_and_red_sprinkles.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:146px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"This BEIN' want CUPCAKES!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I debated that last one. All the others are clued as verbs, and it&#39;s a fine thing to drop the g off an -ING for folksy effect. But BEING was clued as a human BEING, noun ... since when do we folksify nouns?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also debated whether this was Thursday material or not. On the one hand, it&#39;s a sound change (addition? replacement?) theme, standard fare for mid-week puzzles. But given how much difficulty I had explaining it &ndash; and I still don&#39;t think I have it quite right &ndash; perhaps it&#39;s okay for a Thursday. Sure made me think.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;d still greatly prefer trickier concepts for Thursdays, stuff that blows the mind by doing something unique. It&#39;s an important facet of how the NYT crossword distinguishes itself &ndash; not just offering fun, easy puzzles, or tough themelesses, but advancing avant-garde, envelope-pushing material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s those uber-clever Thursdays that first drew me into the NYT crossword. Same for many of my friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a very tough ask. But I think the NYT team is up for the challenge. If I were Will, I&#39;d up the fee for Thursday puzzles. Maybe even hire a set of regulars specifically for this task. Lock them in a room until they&#39;ve delivered 100 great concepts! A million cruciverbalists, on a million keyboards ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Big fan of Jim&#39;s grid execution. Delightful stuff in CUPCAKES with EARL GREY, APPLE PIE. Puts me in LA LA LAND! I would have preferred the grid not to choke down at two points in the middle &ndash; it would have been great to get rid of the two black squares after ACES &mdash; but that would have resulted in some tough compromises. The less than optimal grid flow was worth the price of all those goodies, plus a smooth solving experience.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>I can&#39;t help but anagram and make wordplay with stop signs when I&#39;m driving. It&#39;s annoying. Those big white letters just ask to be messed with. POTS, TOPS, SPOT, OPTS. Am I alone in this? I hope so. Anyway, &quot;Stop Sign&quot; sounds an awful lot like &quot;Stop Sighin&#39;!&quot; [&quot;Quit feeling sorry for yourself!&quot;] &quot; which is where this idea sprouted. Alas, the only other theme-type answer that I found which would work with it was &quot;Finish Lyin&#39;!&quot; [&quot;Quit speaking falsehoods!&quot;]. Nonetheless, the idea kept eating at me. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It doesn&#39;t help that I drive a lot. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than pursue the original idea, I decided to try a variation on it by thinking of other words I could elide to create homophones. I eventually found a set in which the vowel sound changed: LYIN&#39; (for &quot;line&quot;), MOOIN&#39; (for &quot;moon&quot;), PLAYIN&#39; (for &quot;plain&quot;), and BEIN&#39; (for &quot;bean&quot;). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am seriously bothered by the fact that I can&#39;t find a way to use &quot;Stop Sighin!&quot; as a theme answer. It&#39;s like an itch that can&#39;t be scratched. Any help? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a side note, I couldn&#39;t care less about yield sign wordplay. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Delighted to have a second puzzle in the New York Times.</p>"]}
