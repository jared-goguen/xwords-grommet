What an unexpected and funny conclusion to the series! I&#39;ve seen this theme done before, but not with that ending. Gave me a big smile &mdash; I like being pleasantly surprised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So tough to fill a six-themer grid, especially when the puzzle has to run on a Monday (because the theme is so straightforward).

Great bonuses!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The grid had too much crossword glue in it for a Monday puzzle, though. Not one I&#39;d give to a newer solver, as the collection of ARN, BERM, ROOD, ULM, ADM might turn them away from crosswords. Some of that is unavoidable &ndash; what else can the U?M pattern be, once the themers are fixed into place? But I think some of it could have been massaged out &mdash; ROOD, for example (in a region only lightly constrained).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s so important for Monday to feel accessible to a wide audience. I thought the theme did a great job of that, but not the fill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, a nice progression, with a fantastic punchline. I&#39;m hoping some clever constructor will riff on this for Hindus, where the last themer might somehow tie back to the first one.

I&#39;ve only been solving crosswords for about a year and a half&mdash;I began when my cousins introduced me to them over Thanksgiving in 2016. After that, I and was hooked&mdash;I now joke that crosswords are my only hobby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About a year ago, I was hosting a potluck on World Giraffe Day (June 21), and decided to try to make a crossword with giraffe trivia for my friends. It did not follow the common rules of crosswords (it was asymmetrical and had unchecked squares) but I had a lot of fun making it, and all my friends really enjoyed solving it. After that, I decided to try to construct crosswords to submit to be published.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the second puzzle I submitted, and I went through many versions of it trying to get the cleanest fill possible before sending it in. Thank you to my family and friends for always being willing to be test solvers and for tolerating me frequently talking about crosswords! </p>"]}
