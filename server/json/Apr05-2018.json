The most dramatic possible walk-off hit requires each of these elements exactly as written. Watering down the scenario just so you could employ re-usable phrases would kill the tension. For this baseball fan (and my oh my, it&#39;s tough to be a baseball fan in Seattle) Mr. Kahn&#39;s puzzle is outstanding.</p>"],"JeffNotes":["<p>I&#39;m not a huge baseball fan, but I do enjoy the lingo. Some of David&#39;s takes on common baseball phrases amused me. And I liked his effort to tie them together into a story. What better way to end the puzzle than a GRAND SLAM HOME RUN?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Andreas_Fault\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Kluft-photo-Carrizo-Plain-Nov-2007-Img_0327.jpg/440px-Kluft-photo-Carrizo-Plain-Nov-2007-Img_0327.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:146px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"This is California's fault!\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I did wonder about TWO MEN OUT and DOWN BY THREE. The former &mdash; don&#39;t most announcers say &quot;two away&quot; or &quot;two out&quot;? It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve been to a game, but TWO MEN OUT sounds suspiciously like an answer bulked up for crossword symmetry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latter &mdash; I get that it&#39;s a necessary part of the setup for the dramatic conclusion. It just felt arbitrary(ish). Yes, it&#39;s a common deficit, common enough that it&#39;s probably a fine themer. But I would be happy to see BOTTOM OF THE NINTH in any other crossword as fill; not so much for DOWN BY THREE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why not ALL TIED UP, leading to a WALK OFF HOME RUN? Both of those are fine phrases I&#39;d use as fill in other crosswords. Much preferable for me. I know the lengths don&#39;t match &ndash; BOTTOM OF THE NINTH is 16 and WALK OFF HOME RUN is 14 &ndash; but perhaps a mirror symmetry arrangement could have worked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interesting grid design, slipping in two long horizontal pieces of fill. Love, love, love SAN ANDREAS and its clue. Something so fun about the puzzle saying IT&#39;S CALIFORNIA&#39;S FAULT! Not so hot on the symmetrical entry, AUDIO TAPES, as CASSETTE TAPES feels much more strongly in the language. But overall, I like that David didn&#39;t need to pay much of a price to bring these long bad boys into the grid. Good stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoyed the effort to do something a little different with a baseball theme. A couple of iffy themers, but since the grid was well executed, I found the experience mostly entertaining. Who doesn&#39;t like a good story capped by a dramatic finish?</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>I&#39;ve written two books of baseball-themed puzzles and love the idea of cluing baseball jargon in a nonbaseball way. This puzzle actually relates five answers to a situation you might hear described by a baseball announcer, with the appropriate payoff at the end. The puzzle needed to be a little wider to accommodate the longest answers and I tried to make the answers sound unforced. Looking forward to the 2018 season!</p>"]}
