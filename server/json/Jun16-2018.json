today! (The kids these days, they stopped using the term once I started using it.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s tough to have both 1.) a grid-spanning 15-letter entry and 2.) a ton of other long slots (8+) letters, while making all those entries sizzle. There&#39;s so much to love here, from NETFLIX ORIGINAL (thanks NETFLIX, for saving &quot;Arrested Development&quot;!) to ABC ISLANDS to EXCUSE YOU to GEL INSOLES to ANTIDOTES. Sam is one of the best constructors around when it comes to converting his long slots to winners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Lionel_Messi_2017.jpg\" style=\"border:none; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:185px\" title=\"Apparently he's pretty good\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So many great debut entries, too. I love BENTO BOXes at sushi or teriyaki places, giving you a bit of everything. FAT ELVIS is hilarious! Although I haven&#39;t seen LEO MESSI play, enough people gush about him that I think educated solvers ought to at least be familiar with his name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All this, with just STOA and LENOS holding things together? Superb craftsmanship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was so close to a POW! But ...</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>One concern was the CLOVIS / AVON crossing. That&#39;s more due to the tough AVON clue, so it&#39;s reasonably fair.</li>\r\n\t<li>WIN AN OSCAR felt a bit flat &ndash; does it open things up to WIN AN EMMY, WIN A PEABODY, WIN THE WORLD SERIES OF POKER?</li>\r\n\t<li>That TRIES TO clue felt bumpy: [Hopes, with some effort, that one will] felt like it was trying to WIN THE MOST CONVOLUTED PHRASIFYING, OF LEXICOGRAPHY AWARD. Talk about effort!</li>\r\n\t<li>And finally, I wondered if ON FLEEK is an example of TRIES TOo hard. I remember when ON FLEEK was on fleek &hellip; maybe ten years ago.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I know, I know, such ridiculous nit-picking! Themeless standards have rocketed up over the past few years. Even two years ago, this might have been a slam-dunk POW! pick for me. Today, this one just missed out.</p>"],"ConNotes":["<p>I&#39;ll sometimes hear a phrase and know I&#39;m going to build a grid around it. That&#39;s what happened with NETFLIX ORIGINAL &mdash; how fortuitous that it&#39;s a 15! I built the NE stack around it first (having also been meaning to use &quot;Hercules&quot;-inspired <a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DPa0lMzaljTk&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1528898921706000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGnhayTEjpaZUloKPGytfAFB95Hgg\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa0lMzaljTk\">ZERO TO HERO</a> for some time) and then expanded from there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I like the grid overall. I actively chose this version with LENO&#39;S over others with cleaner SW sections because it allowed me to get five entries down there which I love (ON FLEEK / VIA VENETO / ANTIDOTES / FAT ELVIS / RING TOSS), whereas the fully clean versions could only get around 3.5. This will be a mixed bag, I&#39;m sure, especially since ON FLEEK will be utter nonsense to a lot of people, but I think it was worth it. To the ON FLEEK haters: I look forward to your blog comments about the eventual debut of YAS QUEEN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of YAS QUEEN and [Letters following Q], it&#39;s not too late to pick up <a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://queerqrosswords.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1528898921706000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEG6mhj9tBt5JpHOcUrMrljiZD-iQ\" href=\"http://queerqrosswords.com/\">Queer Qrosswords</a>!
